# Sorting
sorting:

# define the filters
# exclude excludes from filter list (obviously)
# type, tonic will try to guess the types from reading in
# I found this can cause errors especially if your data includes fields where some values are string and some a list. Or where not every item has every field.
# my processing script fixes that, but you can also manually set them here (see list of types below)
# I modified the filters.rb script so that the display of filters on the cards page first uses the order provided here, and then all other fields
# remember it's case sensitive
