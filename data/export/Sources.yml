- Description: "\u201CWe\u2019ve written this guidance for you to draw on when you\
    \ face an ethical issue or dilemma in social research. It is intended as a basis\
    \ for reflection and discussion. Like previous Social Research Association (SRA)\
    \ guidance on research ethics, it does not offer rigid rules, but illustrates\
    \ ethical practices to which experienced and respected social researchers generally\
    \ adhere. Our aim is to encourage you to reflect carefully at all stages of the\
    \ research process. While the guidance aims to be comprehensive, it does not claim\
    \ to provide an answer to every ethical dilemma you may face. While it\u2019s\
    \ important to identify and resolve ethical issues and concerns before research\
    \ gets underway, it\u2019s not always possible to anticipate these. The guidance\
    \ is neither exhaustive nor definitive. Rather, we provide clarity about common\
    \ ethical issues that researchers face, and highlight the importance of reflexivity\
    \ \u2013 that is, checking that your behaviour accords with ethical standards.\
    \ The guidance reflects ethical norms, policy and law at the time of writing.\
    \ The SRA will review it as necessary.\u201D (Social Research Association, 2021,\

- Description: "The SHERPA project provides a set of guidelines for both AI users\
    \ and developers, oriented towards operationalising ethical processes. \nThey\
    \ contain a useful expression of underpinning values, and provide e.g. a project-cycle\
    \ model to outline process. \n\u201CThis report contains ethical guidelines for\
    \ the technological development of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data systems.\
    \ It is a Deliverable of the SHERPA project, an EU Horizon 2020 project on the\
    \ ethical and human rights implications of AI and big data. The guidelines differ\
    \ from others in that they are directly related to design and development practices.\
    \ They are intended to be actionable guidelines for systems and software development,\
    \ rather than abstract principles that have no direct application in practice.\
    \ We call such guidelines operational, meaning ready for use. Applying these guidelines\
    \ in development practices would result in more ethical AI and big data products.\
    \ In constructing Guidelines for the Ethical Development of AI and Big Data Systems:\
    \ An Ethics by Design approach, we have incorporated input from a wide diversity\
    \ of stakeholders, SHERPA partners, and insights from other guidelines. In a survey\
    \ of potential guidelines we found over 70 matching documents, which were reduced\
    \ to 25 suitable guidelines that we built on. After an introductory section, we\
    \ devote Section 2 of this report (\u201CHigh-Level Requirements\u201D) to present\
    \ and discuss the high-level requirements that form the point of departure for\
    \ this report. Our requirements are directly based on the guidelines of the EU\u2019\
    s High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (HLEG AI), with minor adaptations\
    \ to improve coherence and fitness for operationalization. This results in the\
    \ following seven requirements that mirror those of the HLEG AI: human agency,\
    \ liberty, and dignity; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance;\
    \ transparency; diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness; individual, societal,\
    \ and environmental wellbeing; and accountability. For each, we specify three\
    \ to four sub-requirements that constitute a first step towards operationalization.\u201D\
    \ (Brey et al., 2020, p. 2)\n\u201CThe guidelines that we present in this report\
    \ are operational in the sense that they are, in our view, ready to be used by\
    \ ethics officers or managers, who have a responsibility for ensuring the implementation\
    \ of ethical practices within their organizations. They are perhaps not directly\
    \ usable by system developers. A further step that is required, but not contained\
    \ in this report, is the training of developers in this new framework, and the\
    \ assignment of different roles and responsibilities to them for ensuring that\
    \ the ethical requirements are met. This may also require the development of training\
    \ materials and operational guides for professionals with different roles in the\
    \ development process. We intend to produce further implementation documents in\
    \ the EU Horizon 2020 SIENNA project (www.sienna-project.eu).\u201D (Brey et al.,\

  title: Project SHERPA guidelines
- Description: "\u201CThe primary audience for this Report are ethics review committees\
    \ or panels who might not be so directly familiar with the methods regularly adopted\
    \ by ethnographers and anthropologists. There is nothing new here for practitioners\
    \ of those disciplines, but it is hoped anyone with an interest in ethics review\
    \ in ethnography/anthropology may also find the information contained here useful.\
    \ Although there are some fundamental core ethical principles that can be applied\
    \ to all human subjects research, the operationalisation of those principles varies\
    \ according to the methodology adopted. A wide variety of research methods can\
    \ be found within the social sciences and humanities (SSH) \u2013 for this reason\
    \ the contribution that can be made to advancing human knowledge and scientific\
    \ understanding from the SSH disciplines may be obstructed or undermined if inappropriate\
    \ review criteria are applied to research proposals. Ethical review should be\
    \ informed by the underlying theoretical and methodological assumptions of the\
    \ discipline which frames the research proposal. This requires the provision of\
    \ a full justification of the research approach from the research proposer, together\
    \ with a properly constituted and competent review panel and a robust, fair and\
    \ transparent review process.\u201D (Iphofen, 2012, p. 5)\n"

  title: British Sociological Association ethics guidelines including for digital
    research and social media
- Description: "\u201CIf you are a student, you may find the 2002 guidelines (IRE\
    \ 2.0) a good starting point of reflection. If you are looking for a draft to\
    \ obtain informed consent, look into the appendix of the 2002 guidelines (IRE\
    \ 1.0, https://aoir.org/reports/ethics.pdf; IRE 2.0, https://aoir.org/reports/ethics2.pdf).\
    \ If you are a researcher, you might want to begin with the 2019 guidelines to\
    \ see if the provided resources are a helpful starting point. If you are looking\
    \ for ways to solve the issue of informed consent you might want to have a look\
    \ into the appendices of the 2002 document. A catalogue of important questions\
    \ to start with can be found in the 2012 guidelines. For additional information,\
    \ especially that focuses on recent technological developments, you might find\
    \ the 2019 document a useful. Especially political and institutional pressure\
    \ on researcher has gained importance. If you are an IRB, Ethical Review Board,\
    \ or member of a similar research ethics oversight board, we highly encourage\
    \ you to take a look into the 3.0 guidelines. Notice that we emphasize deliberative\
    \ processes of ethical reflection. At the same time, we believe that in times\
    \ of Big Data, experimental research needs to be done that requires considerations\
    \ beyond informed consent, but further includes careful reflection on research\
    \ design, the context of research, and the basic requirement to minimize associated\
    \ risks and harms. An ongoing ethical reflection might be more helpful and beneficial\
    \ in the long term for society than now restricting research. If you are a developer,\
    \ you might find it helpful to have a closer look into the Companion Resources\
    \ (6.0). These include \u201CAI and Machine Learning: Internet Research Ethics\
    \ Guidelines\u201D (6.1) and an \u201CImpact Model\u201D (6.4) for ethical reflection\
    \ which may be helpful\u201D (franzke et al., 2020, p. 2)\n"

- Description: "\u201CThese Guidelines are to be used in schools across Europe and\
    \ we shall actively promote them through the Erasmus+ programme. Collectively\
    \ or individually, teachers and school leaders will now have a solid basis to\
    \ venture out and expand their use of these technologies in a considerate, safe\
    \ and ethical way. These Guidelines, along with their use on the ground, are fundamental\
    \ to our ongoing efforts to achieve the European Education Area, while supporting\
    \ the work being carried out by EU Member States. The Guidelines are part of a\
    \ longer journey, while the EU is negotiating and preparing for a comprehensive\
    \ and effective regulatory framework for trustworthy AI, to be implemented across\
    \ all sectors in the EU, including education. And our work does not stop here.\
    \ As we move forward, we will continue to develop a better understanding of how\
    \ to apply these technologies, allowing educators to be even more inclusive and\
    \ pragmatic, especially in primary and secondary education\u201D (European Commission,\
    \ 2022, p. 6)\n\u201CTherefore, I would invite all European teachers and educators\
    \ to take advantage of these guidelines, and to share their feedback on their\
    \ practical application and experience, as this will support our ongoing efforts\
    \ regarding the digital transition in education. We shall also strongly benefit\
    \ from the views and experience of our pupils, their families, and all stakeholders\
    \ in the field of education about the use and impact of AI in their daily work\
    \ and how to make it further beneficial while avoiding risks and negative effects\
    \ to human rights and our fundamental EU values. Our joint work on AI and data\
    \ in education shows a shared commitment to the education community, to our learners,\
    \ to their development and well-being. These Guidelines are an important starting\
    \ point. It is now up to all of us to promote them and put them into practice.\

  title: EC guidelines on AI in education for educators
- Description: "\u201COne of the main aims of producing this guide is to enhance the\
    \ awareness of ethical challenges on the part of research partners and their ability\
    \ to tackle these challenges. Another aim is to encourage research funders, academic\
    \ and other institutions and research ethics committees to understand the complexities\
    \ of CBPR and modify some of their existing requirements to fit CBPR contexts.\
    \ Taking account of the nuances and complexities of CBPR may require institutions\
    \ to change their ways of working and reconsider their values. The ethical principles\
    \ underpinning CBPR emphasise democratic participation in the research process.\
    \ This means it is important that these principles are made explicit, in order\
    \ to ensure all participants are aware of them, and able to discuss what they\
    \ mean in their own contexts and work together to interpret, develop and implement\
    \ them. In summary, the guide to ethical principles and practice has a number\
    \ of purposes, including to: \u2022 raise ethical awareness amongst all research\
    \ partners and participants \u2022 encourage discussion about ethical issues that\
    \ can arise in CBPR \u2022 offer ethical guidance to partners and participants\
    \ in CBPR\u201D (Centre for Social Justice and Community Action and National Co-ordinating\
    \ Centre for Public Engagement, 2012, p. 6)\n\u201C\u2022 inform research institutions\
    \ (including universities), research funders and sponsors about what ethical issues\
    \ might come up so they can ensure CBPR is conducted according to the highest\
    \ standards \u2022 inform research institutions, research funders and sponsors\
    \ about the complexities and nuances of CBPR to ensure they do not impose ethical\
    \ standards that are impractical, patronising to community researchers or partners\
    \ or inappropriate in other ways \u2022 improve ethical practice in CBPR The ethical\
    \ principles and guidelines are designed not to be too detailed or prescriptive\
    \ (i.e. they do not take the form of rules) as this removes control and responsibility\
    \ from the research partners themselves and assumes a fixed model of what counts\
    \ as good research. The ethical principles and guidelines cannot offer simple\
    \ solutions to the inevitable dilemmas and challenges that are part of the CBPR\
    \ process.\u201D (Centre for Social Justice and Community Action and National\
    \ Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement, 2012, p. 7)\n"

  title: ethical use of digital data in human research.
- Description: "\u201C\u2018Steps to Engaging Young Children in Research\u2019 is\
    \ split into a Researcher Resource and a Researcher Toolkit. These have been developed\
    \ to assist researchers to design research which is ethical, sensitive to the\
    \ needs of the children, the community in which they live, whilst also being engaging\
    \ for young children. These steps suggest an initial process of reviewing capabilities,\
    \ developing ethical protocols and building trust and relationships.\nThis Researcher\
    \ Resource provides academic background about why young children should be involved\
    \ in research and provides more guidance on each of the six steps to engaging\
    \ young children in research. For each of the steps guidance is given about what\
    \ the researcher might include in their research when considering each step.\n\
    For each cluster of methods an overview is provided to show the range of the types\
    \ of methods that could be applied with young children, key strengths and weaknesses\
    \ of these methods and a consideration of the potential contextual, ethical and\
    \ capacity issues which may arise through the use of such methods\" (\u201CSteps\
    \ for Engaging Young Children in Research Volume 1: The Guide\u201D, 2014, p.\
    \ 8)\n\n\u201CSteps to Engaging Young Children in Research Case Studies of Learning\
    \ from Practice are included in this Researcher Resource to demonstrate research\
    \ processes have been applied with young children around the world. These demonstrate\
    \ the adaptation and combination of methods that have been applied to answer particular\
    \ research questions in different contexts. These examples are not meant to be\
    \ prescriptive, but to give researchers examples from particular settings and\
    \ to demonstrate the complexity of engaging young children in research. \n...\n\
    The accompanying Researcher Toolkit encourages researchers planning to work with\
    \ young children to consider not only the types of methods needed to answer different\
    \ research questions, but also the context in which the methods are to be applied\
    \ and the skills that will be required to use them. \n...\nA collection of methods\
    \ provides a number of examples of methods successfully used in research with\
    \ young children. This will support researchers to identify and trial different\
    \ methods in their context to answer their research questions. The methods presented\
    \ have been divided into six separate, though interlinking, clusters: \u2022 Gaining\
    \ Consent and Developing Trust \u2022 Interviews and Discussion \u2022 Child-led\
    \ Tours and in-Situ \u2022 Visual Free Expression \u2022 Structured Visuals \u2022\
    \ Drama and Performance \u2022 Play and Games \n\nThis Researcher Toolkit is presented\
    \ as guidance rather than as a \u2018how-to guide\u2019 to be strictly followed.\
    \ Each research problem is unique, each group of children will have different\
    \ needs and abilities and as such researchers need access to a variety of methods\
    \ that can be applied flexibly, modified, and combined in different ways to provide\
    \ a unique research design. Many questions are raised for researchers to consider\
    \ as they engage in this creative process of design. Collaboration with other\
    \ researchers is encouraged. In doing so, if researchers continue to share their\
    \ progress and extend ideas, then a community of practice of those engaging young\
    \ children in research can be expanded and strengthened. Detailed descriptions\
    \ of how methods have been applied in different contexts are included in the Researcher\
    \ Toolkit. These show how methods have been applied in a range of countries and\
    \ settings so that researchers can get ideas of innovative tools and how they\
    \ may be suited to their needs.\u201D (\u201CSteps for Engaging Young Children\
    \ in Research Volume 1: The Guide\u201D, 2014, p. 9)\nStep 2 re ethics sets out\
    \ some clear very specific issues that should (in all cases) or could (depending\
    \ on the research) be considered, with examples of practical guidance.\nIn considering\
    \ each _method (step 5) _an \u201Cethics and context\u201D section provides some\
    \ specific elaboration for that method and examples of research that might be\
    \ drawn on\nIn the _case studies (p.67 on)_- which give examples of research conducted\
    \ - \u201Cethical considerations\u201D are set out briefly.\n"

- Description: "\u201CWho should use the AIATSIS Code? The AIATSIS Code of Ethics\
    \ is intended for use by: \u2022 Any person conducting Aboriginal and Torres Strait\
    \ Islander research. \u2022 Any member of an ethical review body or other body\
    \ reviewing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research, including human research\
    \ ethics committees (HRECs), grant assessment panels and data governance committees.\
    \ \u2022 Sponsors or commissioners of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research,\
    \ which includes any person or public or private organisation that is providing\
    \ financial or other support to the project. \u2022 Those involved in research\
    \ governance and policy relating to research or management of collections, including\
    \ the development of standards. \u2022 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,\
    \ communities and organisations engaged in or with research.17\u201D (Australian\
    \ Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), 2020,\
    \ p. 6)\n\u201CMany Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are actively\
    \ involved in managing research that concerns them, including through the development\
    \ of local protocols and template agreements, establishing research priorities,\
    \ and participating in and leading projects. Nevertheless, there is a positive\
    \ obligation on researchers to ensure communities with which they engage are aware\
    \ of their rights and what they should expect of researchers. In addition to the\
    \ materials on the AIATSIS website, some useful guides have been developed specifically\
    \ for Indigenous communities and organisations engaging with research, including\
    \ NHMRC\u2019s Keeping Research on Track II 2018 and the Lowitja Institute\u2019\
    s EthicsHub.18 This Code applies to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\
    \ research conducted in Australia. We recognise that institutions involved in\
    \ this research vary in size, maturity, experience and organisational structure.\
    \ Similarly, researchers range in experience and skills, including Indigenous\
    \ researchers, researchers with long-term relationships with particular communities,\
    \ and those who are new to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research. Accordingly,\
    \ it is acknowledged that different policies and practices are capable of fulfilling\
    \ the aim of this Code and attempts have been made to ensure that there are appropriate\
    \ options for flexibility in its application.\u201D (Australian Institute of Aboriginal\
    \ and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), 2020, p. 7)\n\nThe additional\
    \ material guide... \u201Cprovides advice for researchers in applying the principles\
    \ in the AIATSIS Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research\
    \ (the AIATSIS Code of Ethics or this Code). It is also useful for ethics review\
    \ bodies to identify practical ways in which the principles should be evident\
    \ in project design. The best ethical research practice occurs in the partnership,\
    \ design and planning stages of a project. However, ethical practice permeates\
    \ every stage of the research process and should be revisited regularly as research\
    \ proceeds. In addition, where a researcher or community encounters a project\
    \ that is already underway, it is important to take stock of the ethical underpinnings\
    \ of the project and adjust as required. In acknowledging this, this Guide to\
    \ Applying the AIATSIS Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\
    \ Research provides practical information on how you may apply the principles\
    \ in four main stages of your research: 1. getting started 2. implementing your\
    \ project 3. communicating research results 4. post-project. This Guide is designed\
    \ to encompass a range of different project methodologies: \u2022 quantitative\
    \ methods (surveys, big data, statistics) \u2022 qualitative methods (ethnographic,\
    \ case studies, interview based) \u2022 mixed methods (participatory action, focus\
    \ groups, workshops) \u2022 working with documents (historical, archival, discourse\
    \ analysis). The Guide offers a range of best practices and ideas for any person\
    \ engaging in ethical research. For more detailed information specific to particular\
    \ types of research, for example large surveys, please refer to the supporting\
    \ case studies on the AIATSIS Ethics webpage.2 We plan to expand our range of\
    \ resources and tools.\u201D (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait\

  title: AoIR report 2
- Description: "\u201CThis new Taylor Institute Guide takes the researcher through\
    \ the essentials of the Canadian standards for ethical practice in the scholarship\
    \ of teaching and learning (SoTL). It began with Lisa Fedoruk\u2019s review of\
    \ the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans\
    \ (TCPS2, 2014), which expanded and clarified the highest level best practices\
    \ necessary for the scholarship done at Canadian post-secondary institutions across\
    \ Canada. Because of the unique challenges of SoTL, where the human participants\
    \ that are the subject of the research are also typically the researcher\u2019\
    s students, this Guide translates the comprehensive TCPS2 (2014) for the researcher\
    \ conducting SoTL research. Of note, a 2018 summary of revisions to the TCPS2\
    \ can be found here. The team at the Taylor Institute wanted to provide a guide\
    \ that laid bare the potential hegemony and power relationships that are part\
    \ of instruction in higher education. In addition to a careful extrapolation of\
    \ the relevant principles from the TCPS2, the author integrated several important\
    \ findings from the scholarly literature on research ethics and SoTL. Next, input\
    \ was sought from a Research Ethics Senior Advisor at the Secretariat on Responsible\
    \ Conduct of Research with the Government of Canada. By including practical strategies\
    \ for ethical practice in SoTL, the unique challenges that compliance with the\
    \ TCPS2 poses for SoTL are brought to life. The work was then sent out to a community\
    \ of Canadian academic researchers for their feedback and contributions (see previous\
    \ page for the list of contributors). The result is a collaboration between a\
    \ broad diversity of experts reflecting the insights of ethical researchers and\
    \ ethics board members and chairs from across the country, to provide a resource\
    \ to complement researchers\u2019 own ethical practices, training, and sound judgement\
    \ as they conduct their scholarship of teaching and learning. Research with human\
    \ participants is complex. Just as the TCPS2 supports researchers in managing\
    \ that complexity, we hope that this Guide will be helpful to SoTL researchers\
    \ in their design process so that their research projects will be sound and robust,\
    \ and the resulting insights can inform and extend our understanding of the processes\
    \ of learning and of supporting that learning with effective, evidence-based instruction\u201D\

- Description: "\u201CWe will consider \u201Ceducational technology\u201D (edtech)\
    \ to include both (a) technologies specifically designed for educational use,\
    \ as well as (b) general technologies that are widely used in educational settings.\u201D\
    \ (Cardona et al., 2023, p. 1)\n\u201CAI can be defined as \u201Cautomation based\
    \ on associations.\u201D When computers automate reasoning based on associations\
    \ in data (or associations deduced from expert knowledge), two shifts fundamental\
    \ to AI occur and shift computing beyond conventional edtech: (1) from capturing\
    \ data to detecting patterns in data and (2) from providing access to instructional\
    \ resources to automating decisions about instruction and other educational processes.\
    \ Detecting patterns and automating decisions are leaps in the level of responsibilities\
    \ that can be delegated to a computer system. The process of developing an AI\
    \ system may lead to bias in how patterns are detected and unfairness in how decisions\
    \ are automated. Thus, educational systems must govern their use of AI systems.\u201D\
    \ (Cardona et al., 2023, p. 1)\n\u201CUnderstanding that AI increases automation\
    \ and allows machines to do some tasks that only people did in the past leads\
    \ us to a pair of bold, overarching questions: 1. What is our collective vision\
    \ of a desirable and achievable educational system that leverages automation to\
    \ advance learning while protecting and centering human agency? 2. How and on\
    \ what timeline will we be ready with necessary guidelines and guardrails, as\
    \ well as convincing evidence of positive impacts, so that constituents can ethically\
    \ and equitably implement this vision widely?\u201D (Cardona et al., 2023, p.\
    \ 6)\n\u201CBelow we address three additional perspectives on what constitutes\
    \ AI. Educators will find these different perspectives arise in the marketing\
    \ of AI functionality and are important to understand when evaluating edtech systems\
    \ that incorporate AI. One useful glossary of AI for Education terms is the CIRCLS\
    \ Glossary of Artificial Intelligence Terms for Educators.11 AI is not one thing\
    \ but an umbrella term for a growing set of modeling capabilities, as visualized\
    \ in Figure 3. Figure3:Components,types,andsubfieldsofAIbasedonRegonaetal(2022).12\u201D\
    \ (Cardona et al., 2023, p. 11)\n\n(Cardona et al., 2023, p. 11)\n\u201C12 Regona,\
    \ Massimo & Yigitcanlar, Tan & Xia, Bo & Li, R.Y.M. (2022). Opportunities and\
    \ adoption challenges of AI in the construction industry: A PRISMA review. Journal\
    \ of Open Innovation Technology Market and Complexity, 8(45). https://doi.org/10.3390/joitmc8010045\u201D\
    \ (Cardona et al., 2023, p. 11)\n**Human-Like Reasoning:** \u201CThe idea of \u201C\
    human-like\u201D is helpful because it can be a shorthand for the idea that computers\
    \ now have capabilities that are very different from the capabilities of early\
    \ edtech applications. Educational applications will be able to converse with\
    \ students and teachers, co-pilot how activities unfold in classrooms, and take\
    \ actions that impact students and teachers more broadly. There will be both opportunities\
    \ to do things much better than we do today and risks that must be anticipated\
    \ and addressed. The \u201Chuman-like\u201D shorthand is not always useful, however,\
    \ because AI processes information differently from how people process information.\
    \ When we gloss over the differences between people and computers, we may frame\
    \ policies for AI in education that miss the mark.\u201D (Cardona et al., 2023,\
    \ p. 12)\n**An Algorithm that Pursues a Goal:**\n\u201CThis second definition\
    \ emphasizes that AI systems and tools identify patterns and choose actions to\
    \ achieve a given goal. These pattern recognition capabilities and automated recommendations\
    \ will be used in ways that impact the educational process, including student\
    \ learning and teacher instructional decision making. For example, today\u2019\
    s personalized learning systems may recognize signs that a student is struggling\
    \ and may recommend an alternative instructional sequence.\u201D (Cardona et al.,\
    \ 2023, p. 12)\n\u201CAlthough this perspective can be useful, it can be misleading.\
    \ A human view of agency, pursuing goals, and reasoning includes our human abilities\
    \ to make sense of multiple contexts. For example, a teacher may see three students\
    \ each make the same mathematical error but recognize that one student has an\
    \ Individualized Education Program to address vision issues, another misunderstands\
    \ a mathematical concept, and a third just experienced a frustrating interaction\
    \ on the playground; the same instructional decision is therefore not appropriate.\
    \ However, AI systems often lack data and judgement to appropriately include context\
    \ as they detect patterns and automate decisions. Further, case studies show that\
    \ technology has the potential to quickly derail from safe to unsafe or from effective\
    \ to ineffective when the context shifts even slightly. For this and other reasons,\
    \ people must be involved in goal setting, pattern analysis, and decision-making.15\u201D\
    \ (Cardona et al., 2023, p. 13)\n**Intelligence Augmentation:**\n\u201C\u201C\
    Intelligence Augmentation\u201D (IA)17 centers \u201Cintelligence\u201D and \u201C\
    decision making\u201D in humans but recognizes that people sometimes are overburdened\
    \ and benefit from assistive tools. AI may help teachers make better decisions\
    \ because computers notice patterns that teachers can miss. For example, when\
    \ a teacher and student agree that the student needs reminders, an AI system may\
    \ provide reminders in whatever form a student likes without adding to the teacher\u2019\
    s workload. Intelligence Automation (IA) uses the same basic capabilities of AI,\
    \ employing associations in data to notice patterns, and, through automation,\
    \ takes actions based on those patterns. However, IA squarely focuses on helping\
    \ people in human activities of teaching and learning, whereas AI tends to focus\
    \ attention on what computers can do.\u201D (Cardona et al., 2023, p. 14)\n\u201C\
    To develop guidance for edtech, the Department works closely with educational\
    \ constituents. These constituents include educational leaders\u2014teachers,\
    \ faculty, support staff, and other educators\u2014researchers; policymakers;\
    \ advocates and funders; technology developers; community members and organizations;\
    \ and, above all, learners and their families/caregivers. Recently, through its\
    \ activities with constituents, the Department noticed a sharp rise in interest\
    \ and concern about AI. For example, a 2021 field scan found that developers of\
    \ all kinds of technology systems\u2014for student information, classroom instruction,\
    \ school logistics, parentteacher communication, and more\u2014expect to add AI\
    \ capabilities to their systems. Through a series of four listening sessions conducted\
    \ in June and August 2022 and attended by more than 700 attendees, it became clear\
    \ that constituents believe that action is required now in order to get ahead\
    \ of the expected increase of AI in education technology\u2014and they want to\
    \ roll up their sleeves and start working together. In late 2022 and early 2023,\
    \ the public became aware of new generative AI chatbots and began to explore how\
    \ AI could be used to write essays, create lesson plans, produce images, create\
    \ personalized assignments for students, and more. From public expression in social\
    \ media, at conferences, and in news media, the Department learned more about\
    \ risks and benefits of AI-enabled chatbots. And yet this report will not focus\
    \ on a specific AI tool, service, or announcement, because AI-enabled systems\
    \ evolve rapidly. Finally, the Department engaged the educational policy expertise\
    \ available internally and in its relationships with AI policy experts to shape\
    \ the findings and recommendations in this report.\u201D (Cardona et al., 2023,\

- Description: "\u201CThis document presents guidelines to assist researchers and\
    \ research ethics committees in recognising and responding to ethical issues that\
    \ arise from the use of visual research methods. The guidelines have been developed\
    \ in recognition of the growing use of visual methods in research. Visual research\
    \ methods present both familiar and novel ethical issues that are often amplified\
    \ by the kinds of data collected in visual research, the processes used for data\
    \ collection and dissemination, and the sensitive settings in which visual methods\
    \ are frequently used. This document has four sections. Part A provides an overview\
    \ of the field of visual research and explains how the guidelines were developed.\
    \ Part B presents six categories of ethical issues for researchers to consider\
    \ when using visual methods. Part C presents guidelines for human research ethics\
    \ committees when considering visual research projects. The guidelines are not\
    \ intended to be prescriptive; rather they identify critical questions that should\
    \ be considered when developing and conducting studies using visual research methods.\
    \ Finally, Part D lists resources that we have drawn on, and that users of these\
    \ guidelines may find informative.\u201D (Cox et al., 2014, p. 3)\n"

  title: Ethical Visual Research Methods
- Description: "\"The **National Statement** is intended for use by:\n- any researcher\
    \ conducting research with human participants\n- any member of an ethical review\
    \ body reviewing that research\n- those involved in research governance\n- potential\
    \ research participants.\nThe National Statement is developed jointly by the National\
    \ Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian Research Council and Universities\
    \ Australia.\nThe National Statement is subject to rolling review. This means\
    \ that parts of the National Statement will be updated as needed, rather than\
    \ reviewing the entire document every 5 years.\nAll human interaction, including\
    \ the interaction involved in human research, has ethical dimensions. However,\
    \ 'ethical conduct' is more than simply doing the right thing. It involves acting\
    \ in the right spirit, out of an abiding respect and concern for one's fellow\
    \ creatures. This National Statement on 'ethical conduct in human research' is\
    \ therefore oriented to something more fundamental than ethical 'do's' and 'don'ts'\
    \ \u2013 namely, an ethos that should permeate the way those engaged in human\
    \ research approach all that they do in their research.\nHuman research is research\
    \ conducted with or about people, or their data or tissue. It has contributed\
    \ enormously to human good. Much human research carries little risk and in Australia\
    \ the vast majority of human research has been carried out in a safe and ethically\
    \ responsible manner. But human research can involve significant risks and it\
    \ is possible for things to go wrong. Sometimes risks are realised despite the\
    \ best of intentions and care in planning and practice. Sometimes they are realised\
    \ because of technical error or ethical insensitivity, neglect or disregard. On\
    \ rare occasions the practice of research has even involved the deliberate and\
    \ appalling violation of human beings \u2013 notoriously, the Second World War\
    \ experiments in detention and concentration camps.\nThis range of possibilities\
    \ can give rise to important and sometimes difficult ethical questions about research\
    \ participation. Two considerations give further weight to those questions. First,\
    \ research participants may enter into a relationship with researchers whom they\
    \ may not know but need to trust. This trust adds to the ethical responsibility\
    \ borne by those in whom it is placed. Secondly, many who contribute as participants\
    \ in human research do so altruistically, for the common good, without thought\
    \ of recompense for their time and effort.This underscores the importance of protecting\
    \ research patients.\nSince earliest times, human societies have pondered the\
    \ nature of ethics and its requirements and have sought illumination on ethical\
    \ questions in the writings of philosophers, novelists, poets and sages, in the\
    \ teaching of religions, and in everyday individual thinking. Reflection on the\
    \ ethical dimensions of medical research, in particular, has a long history, reaching\
    \ back to classical Greece and beyond. Practitioners of human research in many\
    \ other fields have also long reflected upon the ethical questions raised by what\
    \ they do. There has, however, been increased attention to ethical reflection\
    \ about human research since the Second World War. The judgment of the Nuremberg\
    \ military tribunal included ten principles about permissible medical experiments,\
    \ since referred to as the Nuremberg Code. Discussion of these principles led\
    \ the World Medical Assembly in 1964 to adopt what came to be known as the Helsinki\
    \ Declaration, revised several times since then. The various international human\
    \ rights instruments that have also emerged since the Second World War emphasise\
    \ the importance of protecting human beings in many spheres of community life.\
    \ During this period, written ethical guidelines have also been generated in many\
    \ areas of research practice as an expression of professional responsibility.\n\
    But what is the justification for ethical research guidelines as extensive as\
    \ this National Statement, and for its wide-reaching practical authority?\nThe\
    \ National Statement has been extended to address many issues not discussed in\
    \ the previous version, or discussed in less detail. This is in response to requests\
    \ for clearer guidance for those conducting research and those involved in its\
    \ ethical review. At the same time, without compromising the protection of participants,\
    \ the revised National Statement provides for greater flexibility in the practice\
    \ of ethical review, depending on the type and area of research and the degree\
    \ of risk involved.\nResearch often involves public interaction between people\
    \ that serves a public good. There is, therefore, a public responsibility for\
    \ seeing that these interactions are ethically acceptable to the Australian community.\
    \ That responsibility is acknowledged and given effect in the widereaching authority\
    \ of this National Statement, which sets out national standards for the ethical\
    \ design, review and conduct of human research. Its content reflects the outcome\
    \ of wide consultation with Australian communities who participate in, design,\
    \ conduct, fund, manage and publish human research.\" (Preamble)\n"

  title: PANELFIT guidelines for data protection
- Description: |
    "The Public Policy Programme at The Alan Turing Institute was set up in May 2018 with the aim of developing research, tools, and techniques that help governments innovate with data-intensive technologies and improve the quality of people's lives. We work alongside policy makers to explore how data science and artificial intelligence can inform public policy and improve the provision of public services. We believe that governments can reap the benefits of these technologies only if they make considerations of ethics and safety a first priority. This document provides end-to-end guidance on how to apply principles of AI ethics and safety to the design and implementation of algorithmic systems in the public sector. We will shortly release a workbook to bring the recommendations made in this guide to life. The workbook will contain case studies highlighting how the guidance contained here can be applied to concrete AI projects. It will also contain exercises and practical tools to help strengthen the process-based governance of your AI project. Please note, that this guide is a living document that will evolve and improve with input from users, affected stakeholders, and interested parties. We need your participation."

    \ and hence be incorporated in \u2013 existing assessment processes. The Guidelines\
    \ aim to provide guidance for AI applications in general, building a horizontal\
    \ foundation to achieve Trustworthy AI. However, different situations raise different\
    \ challenges. AI music recommendation systems do not\u201D (High-Level Expert\

    \ the interaction between technological capacity and societal adoption and reduces\
    \ the relevance of forecast activities about the consequences of research. However,\
    \ this relative unpredictability does not free scientists of responsibility, but\
    \ should instead motivate ethical reflection and the quest for appropriate perspectives\
    \ and methods. Researchers should be aware that their work de facto contributes\
    \ to changing society and humanity, and the process is not always predictable.\
    \ Although the responsibility for this impact should not be borne by them alone,\
    \ they too have a share of collective responsibility. Against this background,\
    \ the aim of CERNA is to encourage and support researchers in the exercise of\
    \ ethical reflection about their work.\nThis document is addressed to IT researchers,\
    \ developers, and designers. Societal issues are listed but not explored in depth.\

  Description: "\"Autonomous and intelligent technical systems are specifically designed\
    \ to reduce the necessity for human intervention in our day-to-day lives. In so\
    \ doing, these new systems are also raising concerns about their impact on individuals\
    \ and societies. Current discussions include advocacy for a positive impact, such\
    \ as optimization of processes and resource usage, more informed planning and\
    \ decisions, and recognition of useful patterns in big data. Discussions also\
    \ include warnings about potential harm to privacy, discrimination, loss of skills,\
    \ adverse economic impacts, risks to security of critical infrastructure, and\
    \ possible negative long-term effects on societal well-being.\nBecause of their\
    \ nature, the full benefit of these technologies will be attained only if they\
    \ are aligned with society\u2019s defined values and ethical principles.\" p.7\n\

- Description: "\u201CThe purpose of the guidance The purpose is to assist researchers\
    \ and Research Ethics Committees by offering guidance in relation to good practice\
    \ in research involving people with disabilities.4 The guidance may also be of\
    \ interest to research sponsors and funders, those involved in research governance,\
    \ people with disabilities and disability organisations. Ethical responsibilities\
    \ apply throughout the research process. Applying ethical guidance in individual\
    \ research projects is an ongoing matter of judgment and good research practice.\
    \ Researchers cannot simply consider their ethical responsibilities as fulfilled\
    \ once ethical approval for a research project has been obtained. Issues arise\
    \ during fieldwork that still have ethical implications so that \u2018permission\
    \ from an ethics committee to proceed with the research is just the beginning\
    \ of a process of constant self-monitoring by the researcher\u2019 (Rolph, 1998,\
    \ p.135, citing Ristock and Pennell, 1996). Wiles et al. (2004) state, that, for\
    \ instance, in relation to issues of informed consent, there are no simple solutions\
    \ that can be applied universally to resolve all ethical dilemmas. Rather, researchers\
    \ need at all stages of the research process to be mindful of the various issues\
    \ that can arise in the context of their individual research projects. Issues\
    \ can relate to: 1. the needs of participants 2. ensuring ongoing assent or consent\
    \ 3. handling relationships that develop during the research process 4. unanticipated,\
    \ distressing emotions 5. unexpected revelations\u201D (\\[National Disability\

  title: Ethical guidance for Research with People with Disabilities
- Description: "\u201CThe syllabus presented here is designed for use in the training\
    \ of researchers and research ethics committee members throughout the European\
    \ Union and beyond. It is intended to be accessible to scientific and lay\_readers,\
    \ including those with no previous experience of ethical theory and analysis.\
    \ The syllabus will cover key issues in the ethics of research involving human\
    \ participants, including the ethical issues associated with new technologies.\
    \ The scope of the syllabus is the ethics of scientific research involving human\
    \ beings. The case studies relate to a variety of scientific disciplines including\
    \ biomedical and human life sciences, and the social sciences. Readers will be\
    \ introduced to a range of philosophical perspectives and concepts, and these\
    \ will be used to inform discussion of practical ethical issues, but without any\
    \ particular approach being promoted. Similarly, reference will be made to major\
    \ religious views where relevant (e.g. in relation to research involving human\
    \ embryos), but without endorsing or rejecting any particular view. The syllabus\
    \ consists of eight \u2018units of study\u2019 corresponding to the chapters of\
    \ the textbook, each of which will include a list of intended learning outcomes\
    \ for that unit, a brief overview of the topic to be addressed in the unit, one\
    \ or more case studies each with a set of questions to guide discussion by students,\
    \ descriptions of the main issues that should be discussed arising out of the\
    \ case studies, and (where appropriate) identification of further issues for discussion\
    \ that may not arise directly out of the case studies but are related to the themes\
    \ of the unit. The intention is that an instructor should be able to use the intended\
    \ learning outcomes and overview in planning the course and introducing the topics\
    \ to students; the case studies and associated questions can be used either as\
    \ a basis for small group discussion within the classroom or as preparatory work;\
    \ and the descriptions of the main issues can be used by the instructor as a basis\
    \ for guiding and responding to the discussions.\u201D (\\[European Commission.\
