  title: A local school has installed a tool to help tackle antisocial behaviour,
    and truantism risk
- Description: "\u201CAI can fundamentally violate the principle of equal access.\
    \ Universities in the U.S. are using deterministic algorithmic systems to recommend\
    \ applicants they should admit. These are often custom-built to meet the school\u2019\
    s preferences, and have a host of issues that can lead to discrimination, including\
    \ use of historical data of previously admitted students to inform the model.\
    \ Since many elite universities have historically been attended by wealthy white\
    \ males, any model that uses these data risks perpetuating past trends.105 Such\
    \ systems will likely employ ML in the future, which would make bias harder to\
    \ detect. This could result in universities discriminating under the guise of\
    \ objectivity. \n\nLooking forward: If AI is used to track and predict student\
    \ student performance in such a way that limits the eligibility to study certain\
    \ subjects or have access to certain educational opportunities, the right to education\
    \ will be put at risk. Given the growth of research into early childhood predictors\
    \ of success, it is likely that such a system could be used to restrict the opportunities\
    \ of students at increasingly younger ages, resulting in significant discrimination,\
    \ with students coming from underprivileged backgrounds ultimately being denied\
    \ opportunities because people from that background tend to have more negative\
    \ outcomes. Such a system would ignore the students that overcome adversity to\
    \ achieve academic and professional success, and would entrench existing educational\
    \ inequalities.\u201D (\\[Access Now, 2018, p. 28]\\(zotero://select/groups/4907410/items/KIU6F9PR))\

  Description: "\u201CPerpetuating bias in criminal justice: There are many documented\

  title: Perpetuating bias in criminal justice
- Description: "\u201CAI Enables Adaptivity in Learning Adaptivity has been recognized\
    \ as a key way in which technology can improve learning.25 AI can be a toolset\
    \ for improving the adaptivity of edtech. AI may improve a technology\u2019s ability\
    \ to meet students where they are, build on their strengths, and grow their knowledge\
    \ and skills. Because of AI\u2019s powers of work with natural forms of input\
    \ and the foundational strengths of AI models (as discussed in the What is AI?\
    \ section), AI can be an especially strong toolkit for expanding the adaptivity\
    \ provided to students. And yet, especially with AI, adaptivity is always more\
    \ specific and limited than what a broad phrase like \u201Cmeet students where\
    \ they are\u201D might suggest. Core limits arise from the nature of the model\
    \ at the heart of any specific AI-enabled system. Models are approximations of\
    \ reality. When important parts of human learning are left out of the model or\
    \ less fully developed, the resulting adaptivity will also be limited, and the\
    \ resulting supports for learning may be brittle or narrow. Consequently, this\
    \ section on Learning focuses on one key concept: Work toward AI models that fit\
    \ the fullness of visions for learning\u2014and avoid limiting learning to what\
    \ AI can currently model well. AI models are demonstrating greater skills because\
    \ of advances in what are called \u201Clarge language models\u201D or sometimes\
    \ \u201Cfoundational models.\u201D These very general models still have limits.\
    \ For example, generative AI models discussed in the mainstream news can quickly\
    \ generate convincing essays about a wide variety of topics while other models\
    \ can draw credible images based on just a few prompts. Despite the excitement\
    \ about foundational models, experts in our\u201D (\\[Cardona et al., 2023, p.\

    \u201Clistening sessions warned that AI models are narrower than visions for human\
    \ learning and that designing learning environments with these limits in mind\
    \ remains very important. The models are also brittle and can\u2019t perform well\
    \ when contexts change. In addition, they don\u2019t have the same \u201Ccommon\

  title: Automated Essay Scoring is proposed in order to reduce the marking burden,
    improve feedback turnaround, and standardise outcomes
- Description: "\u201COne long-standing type of AI-enabled technology is an Intelligent\
    \ Tutoring System (ITS).27 In an early success, scientists were able to build\
    \ accurate models of how human experts solve mathematical problems. The resulting\
    \ model was incorporated into a system that would observe student problem solving\
    \ as they worked on mathematical problems on a computer. Researchers who studied\
    \ human tutors found that feedback on specific steps (and not just right or wrong\
    \ solutions) is a likely key to why tutoring is so effective.28 For example, when\
    \ a student diverged from the expert model, the system gave feedback to help the\
    \ student get back on track.29 Importantly, this feedback went beyond right or\
    \ wrong, and instead, the model was able to provide feedback on specific steps\
    \ of a solution process. A significant advancement of AI, therefore, can be its\
    \ ability to provide adaptivity at the step-by-step level and its ability to do\
    \ so at scale with modest cost. \n\nAs a research and development (R&D) field\
    \ emerged to advance ITS, the work has gone beyond mathematics problems to additional\
    \ important issues beyond step-by-step problem solving. In the early work, some\
    \ limitations can be observed. The kinds of problems that an ITS could support\
    \ were logical or mathematical, and they were closed tasks, with clear expectations\
    \ for what a solution and solution process should look like. Also, the \u201C\
    approximation of reality\u201D in early AI models related to cognition and not\
    \ to other elements of human learning, for example, social or motivational aspects.\
    \ Over time, these early limitations have been addressed in two ways: by expanding\
    \ the AI models and by involving humans in the loop, a perspective that is also\
    \ important now. Today, for example, if an ITS specializes in feedback as a student\
    \ practices, a human teacher could still be responsible for motivating student\
    \ engagement and self-regulation along with other aspects of instruction. In other\
    \ contemporary examples, the computer ITS might focus on problem solving practice,\
    \ while teachers work with students in small groups. Further, students can be\
    \ in the loop with AI, as is the case with \u201Copen learner models\u201D\u2014\
    a type of AI-enabled system that provides information to support student self-monitoring\
    \ and reflection.30\u201D (\\[Cardona et al., 2023, p. 19]\\(zotero://select/groups/4907410/items/ZI7HP57C))\
    \ (\\[pdf]\\(zotero://open-pdf/groups/4907410/items/4YFQW35Q?page=23&annotation=AIT4G5YT))\n\
    \n\u201CAlthough R&D along the lines of an ITS should not limit the view of what\u2019\
    s possible, such an example is useful because so much research and evaluation\
    \ has been done on the ITS approach. Researchers have looked across all the available\
    \ high-quality studies in a meta-analysis and concluded that ITS approaches are\
    \ effective.31 Right now, many school systems are looking at high-intensity human\
    \ tutoring to help students with unfinished learning. Human tutoring is very expensive,\
    \ and it is hard to find enough high-quality human tutors. With regard to large-scale\
    \ needs, if it is possible for an ITS to supplement what human tutors do, it might\
    \ be possible to extend beyond the amount of tutoring that people can provide\
    \ to students.\u201D (\\[Cardona et al., 2023, p. 20]\\(zotero://select/groups/4907410/items/ZI7HP57C))\

  Description: "\u201CA post-primary school is considering the use of a personalised\
    \ online student dashboard which will provide feedback to learners and support\
    \ the development of their self-regulation skills. Instead of focusing on what\
    \ the learner has learned, the visualisations provide the student with a view\
    \ of how they are learning. The following guiding questions highlight areas that\
    \ require attention: \n- Does the AI system clearly signal that its social interaction\
    \ is simulated and that it has no capacities of feeling or empathy? Societal and\
    \ environmental wellbeing \n- Is access to learner data protected and stored in\
    \ a secure location and used only for the purposes for which the data was collected?\
    \ Privacy and data governance \n- Is there a Service Level Agreement in place,\
    \ clearly outlining the Support and Maintenance Services and steps to be taken\
    \ to address reported problems? Accountability\u201D \n\n(European Commission,\
    \ 2022, p. 23)\n"
