- Challenges:

  Description: "Use of AI in education risks a set of long-range and indirect impacts\
    \ that may be difficult to assess. These include the risks of AI\n1. Reifying\
    \ assumptions, acting to label learners and teachers and thus shape their lifelong\
    \ trajectories, rather than providing useful information to support agency in\
    \ shaping those trajectories. Data in learning environments thus has potential\
    \ to be misused outside those environments, including by employers.\n2. Ossifying\
    \ approaches, through 'locking in' particular models of learning and assessment\
    \ via algorithms, structures of data capture and use, and data infrastructure\
    \ that may be hard to change, particularly here they act to reduce skills or labour\
    \ capacity to intervene. Learning environments must be dynamic to learners and\
    \ their setting. The values that underpin technologies may not always be made\
    \ clear up front, and evidence of their efficacy may be treated as a static given,\
    \ rather than an evolving body of knowledge.\n3. Standardising values, through\
    \ provision of models built on single sets of static values that may not change\

  Description: "\"There are insufficient mechanisms to foresee and measure negative\
    \ impacts, and\_to promote and safeguard positive impacts of A/IS.\n## Background\n\
    A/IS technologies present great opportunity for positive change in every aspect\
    \ of society. However, they can\u2014by design or unintentionally\u2014 cause\
    \ harm as well. While it is important to consider and make sense of possible benefits,\
    \ harms, and trade-offs, it is extremely challenging\_to foresee all of the relevant,\
    \ direct, and\_secondary impacts.\nHowever, it is prudent to review case studies\
    \ of similar products and the impacts they have had\_on well-being, as well as\
    \ to consider possible\_types of impacts that could apply. Issues to consider\
    \ include:\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_Economic and labor impacts, including labor displacement,\
    \ unemployment, and inequality,\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_Accountability, transparency,\
    \ and explainability,\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_Surveillance, privacy, and civil liberties,\n\
    \u2022\_\_\_\_\_Fairness, ethics, and human rights,\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_Political\
    \ manipulation, deception, \u201Cnudging\u201D,\_and propaganda,\n\u2022\_\_\_\
    \_\_Human physical and psychological health,\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_Environmental impacts,\n\
    \u2022\_\_\_\_\_Human dignity, autonomy, and human vs.\_A/IS roles,\n\u2022\_\_\
    \_\_\_Security, cybersecurity, and autonomous weapons, and\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_Existential\
    \ risk and super intelligence.\nWhile this is a partial list, it is important\
    \ to be aware of and reflect on possible and actual cases. For example:\n\u2022\
    \_\_\_\_\_A prominent concern related to A/IS is of\_labor displacement and economic\
    \ and social impacts at an individual and a systems level.\_A/IS technologies\
    \ designed to replicate human tasks, behavior, or emotion have the potential to\
    \ increase or decrease human well-being. These systems could complement human\
    \ work and increase productivity, wages, and leisure time; or they could be used\
    \ to supplement and displace human workers, leading to unemployment, inequality,\
    \ and social strife.\_It is important for A/IS creators to think about possible\
    \ uses of their technology and whether they want to encourage or design in restrictions\
    \ in light of these impacts.\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_Another example relates to manipulation.\
    \ Sophisticated manipulative technologies utilizing A/IS can restrict the fundamental\
    \ freedom of human choice by manipulating humans who consume content without them\
    \ recognizing the extent of the manipulation. Software platforms are moving from\
    \ targeting and customizing content to much more powerful and potentially harmful\
    \ \u201Cpersuasive computing\u201D that leverages psychological data and methods.\
    \ While these approaches may be effective in encouraging use of a product, they\
    \ may come at significant psychological and social costs.\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_A/IS\
    \ may deceive and harm humans by posing as humans. With the increased ability\
    \ of artificial systems to meet the Turing test, an intelligence test for a computer\
    \ that allows a human to distinguish human intelligence from artificial intelligence,\
    \ there is a significant risk that unscrupulous operators will abuse the technology\
    \ for unethical commercial or outright criminal purposes. Without taking action\
    \ to prevent it, it is highly conceivable that A/IS will be used to deceive humans\
    \ by pretending to be another human being in a plethora of situations and via\
    \ multiple mediums.\nA potential entry point for exploring these unintended consequences\
    \ is computational sustainability.\n[Computational-Sustainability.org](http://www.computational-sustainability.org/)\
    \ defines the term as an \u201Cinterdisciplinary field that aims to apply techniques\
    \ from computer science, information science, operations research, applied mathematics,\
    \ and statistics for balancing environmental, economic, and societal needs for\
    \ sustainable development\u201D. [The Institute of Computational Sustainability](http://computational-sustainability.cis.cornell.edu/about.php)\
    \ states that the intent of computational sustainability is provide \u201Ccomputational\
    \ models for a sustainable environment, economy, and society\u201D. Examples of\
    \ applied computational sustainability can be seen in the[ Stanford University\
    \ Engineering Department\u2019s course in computational sustainability presentation](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/cs325/slides/lecture1-S16.pdf).\
    \ Computational sustainability technologies designed to increase social good could\
    \ also be tied to existing well-being metrics.\"\n_p.83-86_\n"
