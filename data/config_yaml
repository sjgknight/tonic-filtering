  description: The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Practice is meant to inform
    practice and education, and it is useful for individual decision-making. Computing
    professionals should approach issues that arise in everyday practice with a holistic
    reading of the principles of the ACM Code of Ethics and evaluate the situation
    with thoughtful consideration to the circumstances. In all cases, the computing
    professional should defer to the public good as the paramount consideration.

  description: The present deliverable addresses a study conducted within the impact
    acceleration project phase, which investigates AI education for professionals
    working with AI design and development. The deliverable describes the work, which
    focuses on promoting AI Ethics through workshops aiming to support consideration
    of multiple values (e.g. privacy; individual, societal, and environmental wellbeing)
    when designing smart information systems (SIS) to ensure development of ethical
    SIS. In particular, three 3-hour workshops were organized, where participants
    were engaged in scenario-based discussions and reflective activities. The underlying
    hypothesis was that engagement in group discussion and self-reflection on one’s
    own values and of whether values have been considered during the AI design process,
    will promote higher self-awareness and self-regulation, and will support value-based
    AI design. Through this short exploratory research study, SHERPA aimed to better
    understand how professionals working with AI design and development approach their
    everyday tasks in the context of ethical values, and to help identify the needs
    and dynamics of a better provision of AI ethics education.

  description: 'These guidelines present the best standards for conducting ethical
    research with Indigenous people in Australia. They comprise 14 principles grouped
    under the broad categories of rights, respect and recognition; negotiation, consultation,
    agreement and mutual understanding; participation, collaboration and partnership;
    benefits, outcomes and giving back; managing research: use, storage and access;
    and reporting and compliance. The document presents each principle and guidance
    on how they can be implemented. It is intended primarily for research proposals
    sponsored by the Institute, and updates the 2nd edition published in 2010.'

  description: 'As the popularity of wearables increases, so does their utility for
    studying emotions. Using new technologies points to several ethical challenges
    to be considered to improve research designs. There are several ethical recommendations
    for utilizing wearables to study human emotions, but they focus on emotion recognition
    systems applications rather than research design and implementation. To address
    this gap, we have developed a perspective on wearables, especially in daily life,
    adapting the ReCODE Health - Digital Health Framework and companion checklist.
    Therefore, our framework consists of four domains: (1) participation experience,
    (2) privacy, (3) data management, and (4) access and usability. We identified
    33 primary risks of using wearables to study emotions, including research-related
    negative emotions, collecting, processing, storing, sharing personal and biological
    information, commercial technology validity and reliability, and exclusivity issues.
    We also proposed possible strategies for minimizing risks. We consulted the new
    ethical guidelines with members of ethics committees and relevant researchers.
    The judges (<italic>N</italic> = 26) positively rated our solutions and provided
    useful feedback that helped us refine our guidance. Finally, we summarized our
    proposals with a checklist for researchers&#x0027; convenience. Our guidelines
    contribute to future research by providing improved protection of participants&#x0027;
    and scientists&#x0027; interests. Author'

  description: This report contains two sets of ethical guidelines – one for the technological
    <i>development </i>and one for the <i>use </i>– of artificial intelligence and
    big data systems, a glossary, two annexes, and a list of references. It is a deliverable
    of the SHERPA project, an EU Horizon 2020 project on the ethical and human rights
    implications of AI and big data. The guidelines differ from other existing guidelines
    in that they are directly related to design and development practices. They are
    intended to be actionable guidelines for systems and software development and
    use respectively, rather than abstract principles that have no direct application
    in practice. We call such guidelines <i>operational</i>, meaning ready for use.

  description: 'In the mid-1990s, the Internet rapidly changed from a venue used by
    a small number of scientists to a popular phenomena affecting all aspects of life
    in industrialized nations. Scholars from diverse disciplines have taken an interest
    in trying to understand the Internet and Internet users. However, as a variety
    of researchers have noted, guidelines for ethical research on human subjects written
    before the Internet''s growth can be difficult to extend to research on Internet
    users.1 In this paper, I focus on one ethical issue: whether and to what extent
    to disguise material collected online in published accounts. While some people
    argue that vulnerable human subjects must always be made anonymous in publications
    for their own protection, others argue that Internet users deserve credit for
    their creative and intellectual work. Still others argue that much material available
    online should be treated as "published." To attempt to resolve these issues, I
    first review my own experiences of disguising material in research accounts from
    1992 to 2002. Some of the thorniest issues emerge at the boundaries between research
    disciplines. Furthermore, many humanities disciplines have not historically viewed
    what they do as human subjects research. Next, I explore what it means to do human
    subjects research in the humanities. Inspired by issues raised by colleagues in
    the humanities, I argue that the traditional notion of a "human subject" does
    not adequately characterize Internet users. A useful alternate mental model is
    proposed: Internet users are amateur artists. The Internet can be seen as a playground
    for amateur artists creating semi-published work. I argue that this approach helps
    make some ethical dilemmas easier to reason about, because it highlights key novel
    aspects of the situation, particularly with regard to disguising material. Finally,
    I conclude by proposing a set of practical guidelines regarding disguising material
    gathered on the Internet in published accounts, on a continuum from no disguise,
    light disguise, moderate disguise, to heavy disguise. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

  description: Working with digital platforms, networks, and data often raises many
    new ethical concerns and unanticipated dilemmas. For example, we have to rethink
    concepts of informed consent and confidentiality (including anonymity), work with
    new, messy and often confusing definitions of the private and the public, and
    resolve unprecedented tensions between the researcher and the researched. The
    British Sociological Association (BSA) cannot provide detailed prescriptive guidelines
    for ethical practice across this complex and often volatile domain. We can however
    offer some guiding principles, methods of thinking through these challenges, and
    specific examples (see our associated case studies) of how these work in practice.
    Our principles accord with other respected professional statutory and funding
    bodies (including HEFCE, the ESRC, and the AoIR). Our position is that our inviolable
    duty of care to our research participants, and to ourselves, should be reflexively
    applied using ‘situational ethics’ that can allow for discretion, flexibility,
    and innovation. To support our guidelines, you may also find this wiki on networked
    system ethics useful, this report by Ipsos MORI and Demos/CASM, this guide by
    The University of Aberdeen on the ethics of social media research, and this methodological
    review paper from National Centre for Research Methods. Twitter users may also
    find @IEthics a useful resource

    to maintain patients" privacy. The major issue stemming from research which includes
    a pathology review is how to handle any changes to the “original diagnosis” generated
    by the “review diagnosis” which may have a patient care impact. <U+F0B7> Non disclosure
    to the patient or their health care team for reasons relating to the impracticality
    or inconsequential and even harmful benefit of communicating revised diagnoses
    to those who may be deceased or seriously ill or may not have a change in their
    management has been strongly recommended and is the general practice. Non disclosure
    of changes to the “original diagnosis” by the “review diagnosis” however is not
    consistent with current expert opinion on ethical research involving humans.

  description: The proliferation of digital data and internet-based research technologies
    is transforming the research landscape, and researchers and research ethics communities
    are struggling to respond to the ethical issues being raised. This paper discusses
    the findings from a collaborative project that explored emerging ethical issues
    associated with the expanding use of digital data for research. The project involved
    consulting with researchers from a broad range of disciplinary fields. These discussions
    identified five key sets of issues and informed the development of guidelines
    orientated to meet the needs of researchers and ethics committee members. We argue
    that establishing common approaches to assessing ethical risks of research involving
    digital data will promote consistency in the ethical standards for research, enable
    the smooth functioning of ethics committees, and sustain public confidence in
    research. We conclude with recommendations for the development of educational
    resources for ethics committees, data management guidelines and further public
    education. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

  description: 'Increasingly, researchers seek to engage communities, patients, and
    stakeholders as partners in the process and products of health research. However,
    there is no existing stakeholder-driven ethical framework for such engaged scholarship.
    We employed an iterative, stakeholder-engaged method to develop a data-driven
    framework for the ethical review and conduct of engaged scholarship. We used consensus
    development conference methods and a modified Delphi survey to engage 240 community
    members, ethicists, and academic researchers. This multi-staged process produced
    a framework with 4 domains: vision of equitable and just research, relationship
    dynamics, community-informed risk/benefits assessment, and accountability. Within
    the framework, 4 cross-cutting considerations and 15 statements explicate the
    stakeholders’ priorities for the ethical review and conduct of engaged scholarship.
    Though the findings are promising, the study is limited in that it focuses on
    stakeholder perspectives, but does not actually evaluate or apply the findings
    in the field. The stakeholder-engaged framework provides a platform for further
    articulation of ethical practices and policy for engaged scholarship. © 2018 Corbie-Smith

  description: 'The ever-increasing availability of data about student activities
    in educational environments presents many opportunities for the improvement of
    learning and teaching through the use of learning analytics. In applying analytics,
    there is an obligation that educators and institutions ensure that data and analysis
    techniques are used appropriately. The range of ethical considerations that educational
    institutions must face is complex and many institutions are still formulating
    their approach to ensuring ethical practice in this field. The purpose of this
    discussion paper is to explore the key ethical issues regarding the use of learning
    analytics and to provide guidance on how these might be considered. It has been
    compiled by a group of learning analytics experts to promote discussion of ethical
    principles, approaches to learning analytics, and topics that still require further
    consideration, particularly in the Australian Higher Education context. The paper
    begins with a brief overview of the field of learning analytics and the emergence
    of the discussion around the ethical use of data within this context. This is
    followed by an examination of seven key ethical principles, including: <U+F0A7> Privacy
    <U+F0A7> Data ownership and control <U+F0A7> Transparency <U+F0A7> Consent <U+F0A7> Anonymity <U+F0A7> Non-maleficence
    and beneficence <U+F0A7> Data management and security <U+F0A7> Access The paper then profiles
    a range of existing learning analytics frameworks used internationally including
    the JISC Code of Practice for Learning Analytics, the Open University’s (UK) Policy
    on Ethical Use of Student Data for Learning Analytics, and the DELICATE Checklist.
    To highlight the ways in which these principles and frameworks can be applied
    to practice, a number of learning analytics applications that are becoming more
    common in educational institutions are then explored. This is followed by a range
    of case studies of how the ethical practice of learning analytics has been addressed
    to date across a range of Australian and international universities. Throughout
    these scenarios and case studies is a discussion of the different perspectives
    of a range of stakeholders including students, staff, institutions and external
    bodies. The discussion paper concludes with seven key considerations for educational
    leaders and practitioners as things you might need to do to ensure ethical practice
    within institutions. These include the need to: <U+F0A7> Recognise that the ethics of
    learning analytics is very complex; <U+F0A7> Develop clear principles and guidelines
    on data use in learning and teaching; <U+F0A7> Actively engage with multiple stakeholders;
    <U+F0A7> Establish transparency and trust; <U+F0A7> Avoid reinventing the wheel; <U+F0A7> Get a move
    on; and <U+F0A7> Develop processes to revisit and recast practice. The discussion around
    the ethics of learning analytics in the Australian higher education context is
    ongoing, and this discussion paper offers a contribution to support and encourage
    its progress and the engagement of a range of stakeholders.'

  description: The Internet has opened up a wide range of new ways to examine human
    inter/actions in new contexts, and from a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary
    approaches. As in its offline counterpart, online research also raises critical
    issues of risk and safety to the human subject. Hence, online researchers may
    encounter conflicts between the requirements of research and its possible benefits,
    on the one hand, and human subjects’ rights to and expectations of autonomy, privacy,
    informed consent, etc.

  description: The Embassy of Good Science ( https://www.embassy.science) aims to
    improve research integrity and research ethics by offering an online, open, 'go-to'
    platform, which brings together all information on research integrity and research
    ethics relevant for researchers, and makes that information accessible, understandable,
    and appealing. It effectively organizes and describes research integrity and research
    ethics guidelines, educational materials, cases, and scenarios. The Embassy is
    wiki-based, allowing users to add -- when logged in with their ORCID researcher
    id -- new information, and update and refine existing information. The platform
    also makes the research integrity and research ethics community visible and accessible
    in pages dedicated to relevant initiatives, news and events. Therefore, the Embassy
    enables researchers to find useful guidance, rules and tools to conduct research
    responsibly. The platform empowers researchers through increased knowledge and
    awareness, and through the support of the research integrity and research ethics
    community. In this article we will discuss the background of this new platform,
    the way in which it is organized, and how users can contribute. © 2022 van Hoof

  description: 'This last chapter provides an outline of the most important social
    research ethics principles and values that should be considered by social science
    researchers and research ethics committees (RECs) who review social science research
    projects. The principle framework of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
    and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human
    Rights (2005) is primarily used to organise the relevant ethics principles and
    considerations. The following ten principles are considered: (1) Respect for human
    dignity; (2) Beneficence and non-maleficence; (3) Autonomy and informed consent;
    (4) Vulnerability; (5) Privacy, anonymity and confidentiality; (6) Equality, justice
    and equity; (7) Non-discrimination and non-stigmatisation; (8) Respect for cultural
    diversity and pluralism; (9) Social responsibility and integrity; and (10) Benefit
    sharing. Lastly, the most important and relevant ethics review questions for each
    of the principles and values that should be posed by social science RECs during
    ethics reviews and deliberations are indicated. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland

  description: The development of Indigenous frameworks for research ethics has been
    a key component of progressing Indigenous aspirations for research around the
    world. They have provided a focal point for challenging approaches to research
    that prioritise non-Indigenous methods and values, and allow non-Indigenous researchers
    to claim expert status over Indigenous peoples, places and knowledges. The theme
    of self-determination underpins contemporary approaches to Indigenous development
    and the repositioning of state-Indigenous nation relationships. This paper describes
    the background, development, and implementation by Maori communities and researchers
    of an Indigenous ethical framework in Aotearoa/New Zealand.

  description: As the use and impact of autonomous and intelligent systems (A/IS)
    become pervasive, we need to establish societal and policy guidelines in order
    for such systems to remain human-centric, serving humanity’s values and ethical
    principles. These systems must be developed and should operate in a way that is
    beneficial to people and the environment, beyond simply reaching functional goals
    and addressing technical problems. This approach will foster the heightened level
    of trust between people and technology that is needed for its fruitful use in
    our daily lives. To be able to contribute in a positive, non-dogmatic way, we,
    the techno-scientific communities, need to enhance our self-reflection. We need
    to have an open and honest debate around our explicit or implicit values, including
    our imaginary1 around so-called “Artificial Intelligence” and the institutions,
    symbols, and representations it generates. Ultimately, our goal should be eudaimonia,
    a practice elucidated by Aristotle that defines human well-being, both at the
    individual and collective level, as the highest virtue for a society. Translated
    roughly as “flourishing”, the benefits of eudaimonia begin with conscious contemplation,
    where ethical considerations help us define how we wish to live. Whether our ethical
    practices are Western (e.g., Aristotelian, Kantian), Eastern (e.g., Shinto, <U+58A8><U+5BB6>/School
    of Mo, Confucian), African (e.g., Ubuntu), or from another tradition, honoring
    holistic definitions of societal prosperity is essential versus pursuing one-dimensional
    goals of increased productivity or gross domestic product (GDP). Autonomous and
    intelligent systems should prioritize and have as their goal the explicit honoring
    of our inalienable fundamental rights and dignity as well as the increase of human
    flourishing and environmental sustainability. The goal of The IEEE Global Initiative
    on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (“The IEEE Global Initiative”)
    is that Ethically Aligned Design will provide pragmatic and directional insights
    and recommendations, serving as a key reference for the work of technologists,
    educators and policymakers in the coming years. Ethically Aligned Design sets
    forth scientific analysis and resources, high-level principles, and actionable
    recommendations. It offers specific guidance for standards, certification, regulation
    or legislation for design, manufacture, and use of A/IS that provably aligns with
    and improves holistic societal well-being.

  description: In this report, we outline the Ethics by Design approach, especially
    as developed in the SIENNA project. We then offer some approaches to teaching
    this methodology so as to support researchers in their practice. The report can
    also be used to embed Ethics by Design, and as a toolkit for researchers and research
    ethics assessors, including for research ethics for artificial intelligence. The
    report begins with a review of Ethics by Design, followed by an outline of some
    challenges and proposed solutions. Then we offer a foundation for applying this
    content in an educational context, first in academia and then as training materials
    that can be used in a business or company setting. In the annexes, we provide
    sample syllabi and course outlines. These materials have been piloted in a number
    of contexts, including as delivered in training sessions for researchers and employees
    within the European Commission’s H2020 funding programme, and as offered to those
    who intend to bid for Horizon Europe funding. The report builds on existing SHERPA
    work to develop guidelines for developers of AI as well as guidelines for users
    of AI. In these ways the task feeds into the EC’s guidance for ethics review of
    Horizon Europe projects.

  description: 'In this article, we examine the ethical dimensions of researching
    the mobile, ubiquitous and immersive technology enhanced learning (MUI<U+2121>), with
    a particular focus on learning in informal settings. We begin with an analysis
    of the interactions between mobile, ubiquitous and immersive technologies and
    the wider context of the digital economy. In this analysis, we identify social,
    economic and educational developments that blur boundaries: between the individual
    and the consumer, between the formal and the informal, between education and other
    forms of learning. This leads to a complex array of possibilities for learning
    designs, and an equally complex array of ethical dimensions and challenges. We
    then examine the recent literature on the ethical dimensions of <U+2121> research, and
    identify key trends, ethical dilemmas and issues for researchers investigating
    MUI<U+2121> in informal educational settings. We then present a summary of research dialogue
    between the authors (as <U+2121> researchers) to illuminate these MUI<U+2121> research challenges,
    indicating new trends in ethical procedure that may offer inspiration for other
    researchers. We conclude with an outline, derived from the foregoing analysis,
    of ways in which ethical guidelines and processes can be developed by researchers
    – through interacting with participants and other professionals. We conclude that
    ethical issues need to remain as open questions and be revisited as part of research
    practices. Because technologies and relationships develop, reassessments will
    always be required in the light of new understandings. We hope this analysis will
    motivate and support continued reflection and discussion about how to conduct
    ethically committed MUI<U+2121> research.'

  description: "A remarkable time of human promise has been ushered in by the convergence
    of the ever-expanding availability of big data, the soaring speed and stretch
    of cloud computing platforms, and the advancement of increasingly sophisticated
    machine learning algorithms.\n\nInnovations in AI are already leaving a mark on
    government, by improving the provision of essential social goods and services
    from healthcare, education, and transportation to food supply, energy, and environmental
    management. These bounties are likely just the start. \n\nThe prospect that progress
    in AI will help government to confront some of its most urgent challenges is exciting,
    but legitimate worries abound. As with any new and rapidly evolving technology,
    a steep learning curve means that mistakes and miscalculations will be made and
    that both unanticipated and harmful impacts will occur. \n\nIn order to manage
    these impacts responsibly and to direct the development of AI systems toward optimal
    public benefit, The Alan Turing Institute's public policy programme partnered
    with the Office for Artificial Intelligence and the Government Digital Service
    to produce guidance on the responsible design and implementation of AI systems
    in the public sector. \n\nThe guide, <em>Understanding Artificial Intelligence
    Ethics and Safety,</em> is the most comprehensive guidance on the topic of AI
    ethics and safety in the public sector to date. It identifies the potential harms
    caused by AI systems and proposes concrete, operationalisable measures to counteract
    them. The guide stresses that public sector organisations can anticipate and prevent
    these potential harms by stewarding a culture of responsible innovation and by
    putting in place governance processes that support the design and implementation
    of ethical, fair, and safe AI systems.\n\nThe guidance is relevant to everyone
    involved in the design, production, and deployment of a public sector AI project:
    from data scientists and data engineers to domain experts, delivery managers and
    departmental leads. Our aim -- and hope -- in writing the guide is to encourage
    civil servants interested in conducting AI projects to make considerations of
    AI ethics and safety a first priority."

  description: 'Objectives: To develop and establish research guidelines of international
    standards that matches appropriate cross-cultural and religious considerations
    of the region. Methods: We followed the guidelines given by the American College
    of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc., Washington DC,
    USA task force on practice to develop research guidelines of international standards
    for our institution. In October 2015 the task team (of a private higher education
    institution in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) qualitatively analyzed the national codes
    and guidelines using 19 ethical protections stated in the other universally accepted
    international guidelines. Results: The electronic search yielded 11 different
    guidelines and documents, of which 4 documents were from Saudi Arabia. When the
    Saudi Arabian documents were compared using 19 universally accepted ethical protections,
    we found one of the document contained 15 of the 19 ethical protections, another
    document contained 9 protections and the least being 5 of the 19 protections.
    Conclusion: Research guidelines of international standards were developed with
    respect to the cultural, traditional, and religious considerations of the Kingdom,
    providing a valuable framework to guide our institutional researchers to conduct
    ethically sound inquiry. © 2019 Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital. All rights

  description: Due to ongoing developments in mobile health research and consumer
    genomics services, genomics mobile applications are set to become an increasingly
    important tool for biomedical researchers, offering to generate new insights into
    human health and shake up traditional research methods. However, as with other
    areas of mobile health research, current data governance and legal frameworks
    have failed to keep pace with these technological developments, generating ethical
    concerns and potential harms for research participants. Here, we explore the specific
    roles and responsibilities of the two major mobile platform providers, IOS and
    Android, in mediating genomics research on their platforms. This mobile platform
    duopoly and their respective app marketplaces play a significant role in the governance
    and design of app mediated research studies through the provision of technical
    infrastructure and contractual guidelines for developers. However, these platforms
    are not clearly regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation in this regard
    and are likely to have divergent and sometimes conflicting interests with researchers
    and research participants. Two regulatory proposals, the Digital Services Act
    and Digital Markets Act, are set to introduce new obligations and oversight for
    mobile platforms. These laws are targeted more toward consumer protection and
    competition concerns, but they also offer new opportunities for promoting better
    data governance on platforms. Taking advantage of these legislative proposals,
    we offer a governance and legal toolkit for researchers, advocacy groups, national
    authorities, and platform providers interested in building a better app marketplace
    for genomics research. © 2022 Kyle J McKibbin and Mahsa Shabani

  description: 'Background: Marginalized communities often attract more than their
    share of research. Too often, this research benefits researchers disproportionately
    and leaves such communities feeling exploited, misrepresented, and exhausted.
    The Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada, has been the site
    of multiple public health epidemics related to injection drug use as well as the
    site of much community-led resistance and struggle that has led to the development
    of cutting-edge harm reduction interventions (e.g., North America''s first supervised
    injection facility, Insite) and a strong sense of community organization. This
    background has made the DTES one of the most heavily researched communities in
    the world. Amidst ongoing experiences of unethical or disrespectful research engagement
    in the neighborhood, a collaboration between local academic researchers and community
    representatives developed to explore how we could work together to encourage more
    respectful, community-responsive research and discourage exploitative or disrespectful
    research. Methods: We developed a series of six weekly workshops called "Research
    101." These workshops brought together approximately 13 representatives from peer-based
    organizations in the DTES with a variety of experiences with research. Research
    101 created space for community members themselves to discuss the pitfalls and
    potential of research in their neighborhood and to express community expectations
    for more ethical and respectful research. Results: We summarized workshop discussions
    in a co-authored "Manifesto for Ethical Research in the Downtown Eastside." This
    document serves as a resource to empower community organizations to develop more
    equitable partnerships with researchers and help researchers ground their work
    in the principles of locally developed "community ethics." Manifesto guidelines
    include increased researcher transparency, community-based ethical review of projects,
    empowering peer researchers in meaningful roles within a research project, and
    taking seriously the need for reciprocity in the research exchange. Conclusions:
    Research 101 was a process for eliciting and presenting a local vision of "community
    ethics" in a heavily researched neighborhood to guide researchers and empower
    community organizations. Our ongoing work involves building consensus for these
    guidelines within the community and communicating these expectations to researchers
    and ethics offices at local universities. We also describe how our Research 101
    process could be replicated in other heavily researched communities. © 2019 The
    Author(s).'

  description: As interest in autism in adulthood grows, so does the need for methods
    to promote the inclusion of autistic adults in research. Our objective was to
    create practice-based guidelines for the inclusion of autistic adults, both as
    research team members and as study participants. We conducted an institutional
    ethnography of three closely related research partnerships that used participatory
    methods with autistic adults over the years 2006–2018. We used an iterative approach
    which combined discussions with community and academic partners and artifact review.
    Guidelines to promote the inclusion of autistic adults as co-researchers focus
    on being transparent about partnership goals, clearly defining roles and choosing
    partners, creating processes for effective communication and power-sharing, building
    and maintaining trust, disseminating findings, encouraging community capacitation,
    and fairly compensating partners. Guidelines to promote the inclusion of autistic
    adults as study participants focus on maximizing autonomy and inclusion, creating
    an accessible consent process, offering multiple modes of participation, adapting
    survey instruments for use with autistic adults, creating accessible qualitative
    interview guides, and handling data from proxy reporters. Although these practice-based
    guidelines may not apply to all research teams, we hope that other researchers
    can capitalize on these practical lessons when including autistic adults in research.

  description: Any implementation of personalized learning and teaching through big
    data will have implications for research ethics. This chapter considers the research
    ethics implications in certain key regulatory documents and the scholarship on
    research ethics and learning analytics. Finally, the chapter provides guidelines
    for use by researchers and research ethics review committees—within the field
    of education in the South African context—specifically focusing on personalized
    learning and teaching through big data and learning analytics. © 2020, Springer

  description: Participant observation as the core method in anthropology is challenged
    by research ethics guidelines and institutional review boards. The demands of
    research ethics committees and authorities rub uneasily against the anthropological
    research tradition and practice. Ethics committees and authorities set unreasonable
    requests on what to report to these authorities when permission is being sought
    for participant observation. In this article, we illuminate such ethics guidelines
    as informed consent consideration of an involved third party and respect for an
    individual's private life and close relations. In particular, the guidelines challenge
    participant observation as a research method as well as diminish the quality of
    the empirical material obtained in qualitative research. The increase in ethical
    regulations and bureaucracy puts the participant observation method in danger.
    We therefore invite the Norwegian anthropological milieu to participate actively
    in the research ethics debate. © 2012 universitetsforlaget.

  description: This Code of Conduct on Data Protection for Responsible Research and
    Innovation (CCDP) is a contribution from the PANELFIT project to the research
    community. PANELFIT (Participatory Approaches to a New Ethical and Legal Framework
    for ICT) is an Horizon 2020-funded project that produced operational standards
    and practical guidelines to address some of the ethical and legal issues posed
    by ICT technologies. The PANELFIT project thus seeks to provide clarity and guidance
    with respect to the issues at the intersection between responsible research and
    innovation,1 ethics, and data protection. The CCDP aims to provide an easy-to-understand
    set of conduct rules that cover the main principles provided in the EU’s General
    Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), as well as a set of desirable practices, specifically
    tailored to the research community.2 There are multiple codes of conduct relating
    to responsible research and innovation. However, these existing codes of conduct
    do not seek to provide guidance on data protection principles, which is a gap
    this CCDP seeks to fill. The CCDP seeks to be an introductory text to data protection
    principles, and does not seek to cover all aspects of the GDPR that may be of
    concern to researchers. Thus, for instance, the CCDP does not seek to cover all
    of the obligations that a researcher may have under data protection laws, nor
    all the rights of individuals whose personal data are used by researchers, or
    the legal requirements around sharing of personal data with research colleagues
    outside the EU, national-level laws on data protection, and so on. The PANELFIT
    project has also created ‘Guidelines on Data Protection Ethical and Legal Issues
    in ICT Research and Innovation’, which aims to be much more comprehensive in this
    regard.

  description: 'Aims: To discuss the need to develop ethical guidelines for researchers
    using sewage epidemiology to monitor drug use in the general population and specific
    precincts, including prisons, schools and workplaces. Method: Describe current
    applications of sewage epidemiology, identify potential ethical risks associated
    with this science, and identify key means by which these risks may be mitigated
    through proportionate ethical guidance that allows this science to be fully developed.
    Results: A rapidly advancing field of research is sewage epidemiology (SE) - the
    analysis of wastewater samples to monitor illicit drug use and other substances.
    Typically this research involves low ethical risks because individual participants
    cannot be identified and, consequently, review has been waived by human research
    ethics committees. In the absence of such oversight, ethical research guidelines
    are recommended for SE teams, peer reviewers and journal editors; guidelines will
    assist them to mitigate any risks in general population studies and studies of
    prisons, schools and workplaces. Potential harms include the stigmatisation of
    participants and, in the prison setting, austere policy responses to SE data that
    impact negatively upon inmate-participants. The risk of harm can be managed through
    research planning, awareness of the socio-political context in which results will
    be interpreted (or, in the case of media, sensationalised) and careful relations
    with industry partners. Ethical guidelines should be developed in consultation
    with SE scholars and be periodically amended. They should include publication
    processes that safeguard scientific rigour and be promulgated through existing
    research governance structures. Conclusions: Guidelines will assist to promote
    an ethical research culture among SE teams and scholars involved in the publication
    process and this will work to protect the reputation of the field. © 2013.'

  description: The Deliverable examines ethical tensions in the use of SIS in a pragmatic
    and comprehensive way, beginning with ethical issues related to the actual design
    of the technologies themselves. Whether or not there are inherent issues with
    their functioning, capacities, and programming (sections 2 and 5). The document
    then identifies the main ethical issues within the debate for the use of SIS in
    practice, outlining 24 of the key ethical concerns found within the literature
    (section 4). While the technologies themselves, and their use, raise important
    concerns that need to be addressed, it is important to not overlook specific domain
    applications and fields of practice, which is reviewed in section 6 of this report.
    <br>The Deliverable will also give a thorough analysis of the main ethical issues
    related to research &amp; innovation aspects of SIS development (section 7). The
    report will subsequently finish with a detailed analysis of the main ethical issues
    and possible solutions within the report (section 8), in an attempt to identify,
    allocate, and group such a wide body of information into the most prevalent concerns
    for society today.

  description: This report analyses the social, ethical, and legal issues of Presence
    technologies and their implications for society. Most generally, Presence is an
    emerging and interdisciplinary ield of research and refers to the cognitive experience
    of being somewhere.1 Presence thus aims at achieving realistic feelings and experiences
    of an environment that does not actually exist, using a broad range of technologies.While
    virtual and augmented realities, CAVEs, head-mounted displays, and high-end cinemas
    are among the more well-known examples, recent developments have brought about
    novel and potentially more intrusive technologies like brain-computer interfaces
    (BCI), which can translate brainwaves into control signals and vice versa.

  description: The challenges involved in the design of ethical, nonexploitative research
    projects with sex workers or any other marginalized population are significant.
    First, the size and boundaries of the population are unknown, making it extremely
    difficult to get a representative sample. Second, because membership in hidden
    populations often involves stigmatized or illegal behavior, concerns regarding
    privacy and confidentiality are paramount and difficult to resolve. In addition,
    they often result in challenges to the validity of the data. Third, in spite of
    evidence to the contrary, associations between sex work and victimization are
    still strong, dichotomies remain prevalent, and sex workers are often represented
    as a homogeneous population. Drawing on three research projects in which the author
    has been involved - all grounded in a sex-as-work approach - as well as the work
    of others, this article provides several strategies for overcoming these challenges.
    Clear guidelines for ethical, nonexploitive methodologies are embedded in the
    solutions provided.

  description: International development and humanitarian work, including research
    and evaluation practice, relies upon the development of strong and trusting relationships
    between practitioners, researchers, local partners and communities. Due to these
    relationships, research conducted in developing countries and particularly in
    relation to development practice raises distinct ethical issues and dilemmas.
    The aim of this chapter is to discuss the importance of the consideration of ethics
    in international development and humanitarian research and how organisations can
    incorporate a culture of ethical inquiry into research and evaluation practice.
    It will highlight that good intentions and policy documents are alone not enough
    for when practitioners are working in development. It will also examine how principles
    and guidelines drafted expressly for and by the Australian international development
    sector is being used as a facilitator of ethical inquiry and good practice. ©

  description: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to produced impacts that are
    highly beneficial, but it also raises concerns about undesirable ethical and social
    consequences. There is an array of activities that aim to address these undesirable
    consequences, ranging from proposals for regulation such as the EU AI Act to ethics
    guidelines to design methodologies, professional guidance or standardisation.
    One option that is increasingly explored is to develop impact assessments specifically
    geared for the needs of AI. A number of such AI impact assessments (AI-IAs) have
    already been proposed. This document undertakes a systematic review of these AI-IAs
    with the aim of identifying whether there are common themes and approaches. This
    research is important to establish a baseline for AI-IAs that can help organisations
    identify AI-IAs that are most relevant to their needs and that can serve as a
    measure for legislators and regulators to determine the role that AI-IAs can play
    in the governance of the broader AI ecosystem.

  description: Responsible research and innovation is a process that seeks to promote
    creativity and opportunities for science and innovation that are socially desirable
    and undertaken in the public interest. Responsible research and innovation acknowledges
    that innovation can raise questions and dilemmas, is often ambiguous in terms
    of purposes and motivations and unpredictable in terms of impacts, beneficial
    or otherwise.

  description: Information communications technologies (ICTs) like laptops, smartphones
    and portable storage devices facilitate travel, communication and documentation
    for researchers who conduct fieldwork. But despite increasing awareness about
    the ethical complications associated with using ICTs among journalists and humanitarians,
    there are few reflections on digital security among researchers. This article
    seeks to raise awareness of this important question by outlining three sets of
    ethical challenges related to digital security that may arise during the course
    of field research. These ethical challenges relate to (i) informed consent and
    confidentiality, (ii) collecting, transferring and storing sensitive data, and
    (iii) maintaining the personal security and integrity of the researcher. To help
    academics reflect on and mitigate these risks, the article underscores the importance
    of digital risk assessments and develops ten basic guidelines for field research
    in the digital age. © The Author(s) 2018.

  description: In response to the atrocities committed by German medical researchers
    before and during World War II, the judges at the Nuremberg doctors' trial formulated
    the first set of international ethics guidelines for biomedical research on humans,
    the Nuremberg Code. Subsequently, numerous other guidelines have been developed
    and revised, beginning with the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki
    and followed by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences'
    International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects
    and the International Council on Harmonization's Guideline for Good Clinical Practice,
    to mention only the most influential. This article compares these four documents
    on how they protect participants in biomedical research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

  description: High quality close-to-practice research requires the robust use of
    research design, theory and methods to address clearly defined research questions,
    through an iterative process of research and application. The research process
    will be well documented and the conclusions that are drawn will be appropriate
    to the strengths and weaknesses of the design, theory and methods used. Such research
    will draw upon practitioners’ and researchers’ reflections on both practice and

    From the exec summary:
    “The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research is informed by the recognition of and respect for the rights of Indigenous1 peoples as articulated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.2 As such, AIATSIS recognises that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have the right to be fully engaged in any processes, projects and activities that may impact on them. The AIATSIS Code outlines four principles that underpin ethical Australian Indigenous research; these are: Indigenous self-determination, Indigenous leadership, impact and value, and sustainability and accountability. Each principle frames a set of responsibilities for researchers, institutions and review bodies when conducting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research includes all research that impacts on or is of particular significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, including the planning, collection, analysis and dissemination of information or knowledge, in any format or medium, which is about, or may affect, Indigenous peoples, either collectively or individually. The AIATSIS Code sets national standards for the ethical and responsible conduct of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research, across all disciplines and methodologies. It is for use by those undertaking research, reviewing research or funding research, including individuals, universities, governments, industry and community organisations. This Code is consistent with and supports the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research and the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research.3 It provides guidance on the application of those standards in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research. The AIATSIS Code is issued pursuant to AIATSIS’ legislative function to provide leadership in ethics. Compliance with this Code is required for all research funded by or undertaken under the auspices of AIATSIS, the Australian Research Council (ARC) and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), and other institutions or bodies that have adopted the AIATSIS Code.” (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), 2020, p. 2)

    “Who should use the AIATSIS Code? The AIATSIS Code of Ethics is intended for use by: • Any person conducting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research. • Any member of an ethical review body or other body reviewing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research, including human research ethics committees (HRECs), grant assessment panels and data governance committees. • Sponsors or commissioners of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research, which includes any person or public or private organisation that is providing financial or other support to the project. • Those involved in research governance and policy relating to research or management of collections, including the development of standards. • Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, communities and organisations engaged in or with research.17” (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), 2020, p. 6)
    “Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are actively involved in managing research that concerns them, including through the development of local protocols and template agreements, establishing research priorities, and participating in and leading projects. Nevertheless, there is a positive obligation on researchers to ensure communities with which they engage are aware of their rights and what they should expect of researchers. In addition to the materials on the AIATSIS website, some useful guides have been developed specifically for Indigenous communities and organisations engaging with research, including NHMRC’s Keeping Research on Track II 2018 and the Lowitja Institute’s EthicsHub.18 This Code applies to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research conducted in Australia. We recognise that institutions involved in this research vary in size, maturity, experience and organisational structure. Similarly, researchers range in experience and skills, including Indigenous researchers, researchers with long-term relationships with particular communities, and those who are new to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that different policies and practices are capable of fulfilling the aim of this Code and attempts have been made to ensure that there are appropriate options for flexibility in its application.” (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), 2020, p. 7)

    “AIATSIS first published ethics guidelines in 1999 and, at the time, they represented a new approach to research ethics that repositioned Indigenous peoples from subjects of research to partners in research. The guidelines were regularly revised to reflect developments in critical areas that had emerged since previous editions. To mark the twentieth anniversary of the AIATSIS guidelines, we have undertaken a comprehensive review to ensure that AIATSIS continues to set the highest standards of ethics and support for human rights in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research. While the principles in the 2012 edition are largely retained, they have been reorganised into a new framework and augmented to reflect emerging standards and developments.1 The review was guided and informed by the AIATSIS Research Ethics Committee, the AIATSIS Research Advisory Committee, the AIATSIS Council, roundtables of Pro Vice Chancellors (Indigenous), consultation with key stakeholders, public submissions and expert advice.” (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), 2020, p. 2)

    “This guide provides advice for researchers in applying the principles in the AIATSIS Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research (the AIATSIS Code of Ethics or this Code). It is also useful for ethics review bodies to identify practical ways in which the principles should be evident in project design. The best ethical research practice occurs in the partnership, design and planning stages of a project. However, ethical practice permeates every stage of the research process and should be revisited regularly as research proceeds. In addition, where a researcher or community encounters a project that is already underway, it is important to take stock of the ethical underpinnings of the project and adjust as required. In acknowledging this, this Guide to Applying the AIATSIS Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research provides practical information on how you may apply the principles in four main stages of your research: 1. getting started 2. implementing your project 3. communicating research results 4. post-project. This Guide is designed to encompass a range of different project methodologies: • quantitative methods (surveys, big data, statistics) • qualitative methods (ethnographic, case studies, interview based) • mixed methods (participatory action, focus groups, workshops) • working with documents (historical, archival, discourse analysis). The Guide offers a range of best practices and ideas for any person engaging in ethical research. For more detailed information specific to particular types of research, for example large surveys, please refer to the supporting case studies on the AIATSIS Ethics webpage.2 We plan to expand our range of resources and tools. If you have suggestions for or contributions to the AIATSIS ethics resources, please contact us at ethics@aiatsis.gov.au” (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), 2020, p. 3)

  note: "Structure:\n\nIntroduction - situates need with respect to target topic and
    audience(s)\n\n\nPrinciples of ethical research - states the 6 broad categories
    under which the 14 principles sit, each category then receives a top-level heading
    which: (1) states the underlying principles, (2) provides a brief description,
    (3) provides bullet-pointed key considerations in ‘applying the principle’ (these
    vary in length), in places linking to external relevant framework e.g. Article
    3 of the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Those categories
    and principles are:\n\n\nRights, respect and recognition\n\nPrinciple 1 Recognition
    of the diversity and uniqueness of peoples, as well as of individuals, is essential.
    \n\n\nPrinciple 2 The rights of Indigenous peoples to self-determination must
    be recognised. \n\n\nPrinciple 3 The rights of Indigenous peoples to their intangible
    heritage must be recognised. \n\n\nPrinciple 4 Rights in the traditional knowledge
    and traditional cultural expressions of Indigenous peoples must be respected,
    protected and maintained. \n\n\nPrinciple 5 Indigenous knowledge, practices and
    innovations must be respected, protected and maintained. \n\n\n\nNegotiation,
    consultation, agreement and mutual understanding\n\nPrinciple 6 Consultation,
    negotiation and free, prior and informed consent are the foundations for research
    with or about Indigenous peoples. \n\n\nPrinciple 7 Responsibility for consultation
    and negotiation is ongoing. \n\n\nPrinciple 8 Consultation and negotiation should
    achieve mutual understanding about the proposed research. \n\n\nPrinciple 9 Negotiation
    should result in a formal agreement for the conduct of a research project. \n\n\n\nParticipation,
    collaboration and partnership \n\nPrinciple 10 Indigenous people have the right
    to full participation appropriate to their skills and experiences in research
    projects and processes. \n\n\n\nBenefits, outcomes, and giving back \n\nPrinciple
    11 Indigenous people involved in research, or who may be affected by research,
    should benefit from, and not be disadvantaged by, the research project. \n\n\nPrinciple
    12 Research outcomes should include specific results that respond to the needs
    and interests of Indigenous people. \n\n\n\nManaging research: use, storage and
    access\n\nPrinciple 13 Plans should be agreed for managing use of, and access
    to, research results. \n\n\n\nReporting and compliance\n\nPrinciple 14 Research
    projects should include appropriate mechanisms and procedures for reporting on
    ethical aspects of the research and complying with these guidelines.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n"

    “THE REVIEW PROCESS In 2015 a subcommittee was asked to review the 2011 guidelines and suggest what may need updating, particularly how they accommodate and facilitate practitioner research and how they respond to technological development. The scoping group was chaired by Anna MountfordZimdars and included Rachel Brooks, Alison Fox and David Lundie. Their recommendations led to BERA establishing a new working group in 2016 to follow up; this was chaired by myself and included Ruth Boyask, Alison Fox, David Lundie, Marilyn Leask and Lesley Saunders (representing BERA’s Independent Researchers Forum). The team was very capably assisted by Jodie Pennacchia. We undertook extensive external consultations. i. Reference to key publications and resources, including the published works and ethical frameworks of other professional bodies, learned societies and research councils. ii. An online survey of the whole BERA membership, answered by 135 individuals, 73 per cent of whom worked in higher education institutions (HEIs). iii. Two rounds of email and telephone interviews with invited colleagues from a wide range of organisations within and beyond academia (across the four jurisdictions within the UK) who are known to have a strong interest and relevant expertise in the field of research ethics and/or who represented schools, policymakers and funders. Fifty-nine were approached, and most of the 21 experts who replied gave substantial responses. Our questions covered the uses and fitness-for-purpose of the guidelines, their coverage of issues and methodologies, and suggestions for improvement. Deliberation within the group and iterative review of the guidelines followed each external input. We undertook collaborative writing through online (Google Docs) and face-to-face discussions before reaching consensus. In several of the revision rounds, we divided the document into thirds by section and worked together in pairs before reviewing other pairs’ revisions. Five invited experts drawn from the wider consultative pool made direct suggestions on sections of the Google Doc that related to their particular expertise. The use of Google Docs fostered dialogue, transparency and efficiency in our work. The draft presented to BERA Council in 2017 subsequently underwent independent peer review and polishing to make the language as accessible as possible.” (Hennessy, 2018, p. 15)

    Hennessy, Sara. “The 2018 BERA Ethical Guidelines: Behind the Scenes of the Revision.” Research Intelligence, 2018. https://www.bera.ac.uk/publication/summer-2018.
    “The working group oversaw the review of the guidelines and engaged in consultation with BERA members and a wide range of experts, learned societies and stakeholders,24 as well as reviewing key publications. Significant revisions were made in order to update the guidelines to incorporate new concerns such as those raised by online and social media research. The consultation process led the review to consider more explicitly the range of contexts for educational research, in particular: research by organisations outside higher education; school-based and practitioner research; studies carried out in international contexts; online and social media-related research. These revised guidelines are the result of considered deliberation about the ethical issues associated with changes in society and technological advances as they affect educational research. In response to our consultations, the guidelines themselves now take a more deliberative and less prescriptive approach in their language.” (BERA, 2018, p. 40)

    “The first part of this chapter is built around the seven ethical requirements included in the recommendations published by the High-Level Expert Group on AI4 in their ‘Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI’.5 These recommendations were recently analyzed by the SHERPA project,6 which included an extensive analysis of the ethical issues involved when developing adequate tools to face these challenges. In light of this commendable effort, it would be redundant to include an extensive analysis here of the same topic (AI) from the same perspective (ethics). Instead, what we have tried to do in this document is provide a complementary analysis. These Guidelines aim to find the overlap between the ethical recommendations made by the High-Level Expert Group on AI and the legal framework created by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on data protection issues.” (Beriain et al., 2021, p. 2)

    “this report focuses mainly on AI developers: organizations willing to develop AI tools. These organizations become controllers as soon as they start processing personal data. In a similar vein, the terms ‘tool’, ‘solution’, ‘model’ and ‘development’ should be considered as synonymous in the context of this analysis.” (Beriain et al., 2021, p. 2)
    “The different sections in this part of the document contain only what we consider to be strictly necessary to understand the core arguments of the ethical and legal issues at stake. We have included checklists that should help controllers to determine whether they are addressing the issues accurately, and a further reading section for readers to consult if necessary. Footnotes provide further references to the most important statements” (Beriain et al., 2021, p. 2)

    “Research 101 was a series of six weekly workshops (February to April 2018) to discuss 1 research and ethics in the Downtown Eastside (DTES). These workshops emerged out of a wider conversation on ethics in cultural production (e.g. research, media, artmaking) within the DTES convened by Hives for Humanity and supported by Simon Fraser University’s Vancity Office of Community Engagement. Research 101 was but one of several components of this wider work to gather local knowledge and expertise on community ethics in the DTES into materials that could help empower the community. Six to thirteen representatives from several diverse DTES organizations met each week to discuss their experiences with research, the wider context of research in the DTES, and community expectations for more ethical research practice. These guidelines are based on our discussions, and build on the work of the many other organizations, communities and individuals who have gone before us in expressing what it means for university researchers (and other people coming from outside the DTES community) to treat communities like the DTES with the respect and dignity they deserve, and expect. Lindsay Deane (SFU research assistant) took notes on workshop participants’ perspectives and suggestions during weekly discussions and Scott Neufeld (SFU PhD student) drew on these notes to draft the manifesto for workshopping and review at the final Research 101 workshop. We agreed at the final workshop that the manifesto was co-created by all workshop participants and that the names of everyone who participated in at least one workshop and who consented to being identified (some chose not to) would be listed alphabetically by last name as co-authors” (Boilevin et al., p. 2)

    and Potential of Research in the DTES - gives a table with sets of pitfalls/potentials
    of research (they aren’t tensions/matched within rows), and sets context of community
    engagement as reflecting desire for research that matters\n\n\nWhat we expect
    from researchers who want to work with us - sets out research process as 4 stages,
    with some key principles for engagement. The key issues considered are then elaborated
    in top-level headed sections (as follows)\n\n\nGetting to know each other - sets
    out process, and key ethical issues of relevance (power, motivation, experience,
    capacity, respect for trauma, politics, funding, feedback, reciprocity, actionability
    of the work)\n\n\nEthical review: Whose ethics - as above, 3 overarching process
    elements (make REC application available to view and understand, consider how
    communtiy holds you to account to your protocol, set out memorandum of understanding),
    and areas RECs may not consider but are important (reciprocity, trauma-informed,
    accessible, ongoing consent, participant-review of analysis, ethics for community,
    wider consequences)\n\n\nDoing the research: Power and “Peers” - as above, from
    a ‘nothing about us without us’ lens (focus: dignity, non-elitist, non-entitled,
    equality, equal relationships, accessibility, trauma-informed, allyship, space
    to disagree, power, payment, community trust, break down stigma)\n\n\nReciprocity
    and Bringing the Research Back - key foci: You do the organisation, translate
    the work, meaningful territorial acknowledgement, meaningful involvement, community-friendly
    food, comfortable and accessible spaces, show gratitude, receive feedback, longer
    term research collaboration and action, honoraria, celebrate community. Co-author,
    create plain language summaries, \n\n\nSupporting the manifesto - provides set
    of endorsements\n\n\nRecommendations for Developing a Community Research Ethics
    Board (CREB) in the DTES - sets out some recommendations\n\n"

    requirements - distinguishes high, intermediate, operational, and specific operational
    level guidelines or requirements. High level are at the principle or values level.
    The 7 high level requirements with sub-requirements are noted and stepped through
    in paragraphs: “1 Human agency, liberty and dignity: Positive liberty, negative
    liberty and human dignity 2 Technical robustness and safety: Including resilience
    to attack and security, fall back plan and general safety, accuracy, reliability
    and reproducibility 3 Privacy and data governance: Including respect for privacy,
    quality and integrity of data, access to data, data rights and ownership 4 Transparency:
    Including traceability, explainability and communication 5 Diversity, non-discrimination
    and fairness: Avoidance and reduction of bias, ensuring fairness and avoidance
    of discrimination, and inclusive stakeholder engagement 6 Individual, societal

    redress, and human oversight” (Brey et al., 2021, p. 20)\n\n\nApplying ethics
    to development models for AI and big data systems - uses CRISP-DM and Agile as
    process-oriented models to elaborate where ethical issues arise and may be addressed
    in practice. Each phase is discussed and the requirements (as above) are discussed
    in relation to the phase, any issues that may arise, and key requirements or recommendations.
     At the end, the phases are mapped against each ethical requirement in a table
    indicating at which phase each is most likely to arise\n\n\nSpecific operational
    ethics requirements - Steps through each ethical principle and provides requirements
    for ethical action\n\n\nSpecial topics for consideration - sets out key ethical
    issues relating to “types of data, functions, techniques, systems, and application
    areas. For each section it presents a number of requirements to be taken, complimentary
    to the requirements provided in section 3 and 4.” (Brey et al., 2021, p. 50).

    “The guidelines have been drafted following an analysis of over 70 sets of potentially suitable ethical guidelines for AI and big data, which was reduced to 25 suitable guidelines. These 25 guidelines were then subject to a closer analysis, and our final product is closely aligned with the ethical guidelines of the EU High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (HLEG AI). A complete analysis can be found in Annex 2. Following the initial analysis, draft guidelines were submitted to the SHERPA Stakeholder Advisory Board and other interested stakeholders identified through the project for comment. Once initial comments were collected and incorporated into the documents, two workshops were held to engage stakeholders with the guidelines and envision them as to the value of an ethics by design approach. Feedback from the workshops was incorporated into the documents, which were then re-sent to stakeholders for a further round of comments. These were again incorporated before a final version was sent to stakeholders for approval. In this way, the three rounds of stakeholder comment and the workshop ensured that the guidelines were subject to significant stakeholder engagement. As such, they reflect real-world concerns, practices, and solutions which may not have been obvious to the original drafters of the guidelines. Stakeholder engagement is developed in Annex 1.” (Brey et al., 2021, p. 1)

    “This report contains two sets of ethical guidelines – one for the technological development and one for the use – of artificial intelligence and big data systems, a glossary, two annexes, and a list of references. It is a deliverable of the SHERPA project, an EU Horizon 2020 project on the ethical and human rights implications of AI and big data. The guidelines differ from other existing guidelines in that they are directly related to design and development practices. They are intended to be actionable guidelines for systems and software development and use respectively, rather than abstract principles that have no direct application in practice. We call such guidelines operational, meaning ready for use. Applying these guidelines in development or use practices would result in more ethical AI and big data products or uses of such products. The development guidelines can also be useful in ethical research assessment, with the reservation that these guidelines focus on achieving an ethical AI and big data system and the impact of such systems, not the process as such (ethical research boards are often concerned with the process). Following the guidelines would result in more ethical AI and big data research.” (Brey et al., 2021, p. 1)

    “The guidelines that we present in this report are operational in the sense that they are, in our view, ready to be used by ethics officers or managers, who have a responsibility for ensuring the implementation of ethical practices within their organizations. They are perhaps not directly usable by system developers. A further step that is required, but not contained in this report, is the training of developers in this new framework, and the assignment of different roles and responsibilities to them for ensuring that the ethical requirements are met. This may also require the development of training materials and operational guides for professionals with different roles in the development process. We intend to produce further implementation documents in the EU Horizon 2020 SIENNA project (www.sienna-project.eu).” (Brey et al., 2020, p. 3)

    “This report contains ethical guidelines for the technological development of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data systems. It is a Deliverable of the SHERPA project, an EU Horizon 2020 project on the ethical and human rights implications of AI and big data. The guidelines differ from others in that they are directly related to design and development practices. They are intended to be actionable guidelines for systems and software development, rather than abstract principles that have no direct application in practice. We call such guidelines operational, meaning ready for use. Applying these guidelines in development practices would result in more ethical AI and big data products. In constructing Guidelines for the Ethical Development of AI and Big Data Systems: An Ethics by Design approach, we have incorporated input from a wide diversity of stakeholders, SHERPA partners, and insights from other guidelines. In a survey of potential guidelines we found over 70 matching documents, which were reduced to 25 suitable guidelines that we built on. After an introductory section, we devote Section 2 of this report (“High-Level Requirements”) to present and discuss the high-level requirements that form the point of departure for this report. Our requirements are directly based on the guidelines of the EU’s High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (HLEG AI), with minor adaptations to improve coherence and fitness for operationalization. This results in the following seven requirements that mirror those of the HLEG AI: human agency, liberty, and dignity; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness; individual, societal, and environmental wellbeing; and accountability. For each, we specify three to four sub-requirements that constitute a first step towards operationalization.” (Brey et al., 2020, p. 2)

    “In constructing Guidelines for the Ethical Use of AI and Big Data Systems, we have incorporated input from a wide diversity of stakeholders, SHERPA partners, and insights from other guidelines. In a survey of potential guidelines we found over 70 matching documents, which were reduced to 25 suitable guidelines that we built on. After an introductory section, we devote Section 2 of this report (“High-Level Requirements”) to present and discuss the high-level requirements that form the point of departure for this report. Our requirements are directly based on the guidelines of the EU’s High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (HLEG AI), with minor adaptations to improve coherence and fitness for operationalization. This results in the following seven requirements, which mirror those of the HLEG AI: human agency, liberty, and dignity; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness; individual, societal, and environmental wellbeing; and accountability. For each, we specify three to four sub-requirements that constitute a first step towards operationalization.” (Brey et al., 2020, p. 2)

    “The guidelines differ from others in that they are directly related to practices of deployment, implementation and use. They are intended to be actionable guidelines for organisations that use these systems, rather than abstract principles that have no direct application in practice. We call such guidelines operational, meaning ready for use. Applying these guidelines in practice would result in more ethical use of AI and big data technologies.” (Brey et al., 2020, p. 2)

    “This chapter introduces the fundamental guidelines that researchers and innovators should follow to ensure adequate compliance with the regulations in force. The recommendations developed do not intend to be exhaustive nor do they allow us to enter into each and every detail of the activities to which they refer. Those who develop them should be sure of the particularities that their own national systems may present. In case of doubt, it is always better to have the help of a DPO or legal advisor who can advise on the issue at stake.” (Campillo and Parrilla, 2022, p. 1)

    “Methodology <U+F0B7> Working Group. 6 members from the Canadian Association of Pathologists (CAP-ACP) in 2010 volunteered to form a working group sponsored by the CAP-ACP executive committee entitled “Guidelines on the Review of Pathology in the Research Context (RPRC guideline)”. Four members* formed the writing group.” (CAP-ACP, 2012, p. 3)
    “<U+F0B7> Literature Review. The published literature was reviewed using the following terms: pathology, clinical, forensic, molecular, surgical, telepathology, bioethical issues, bioethics, ethics, codes of ethics, ethics professional, ethics clinical, ethics medical, ethics committee, research, ethics research, principle-based ethics, disclosure, truth disclosure, diagnostic errors, and referral and consultation. <U+F0B7> Online Survey of Laboratory Practice in Canada. During the months of June and July, 2011 the working group surveyed chairs of Canadian university departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and medical directors of laboratories in Canada to gather up to date information on the existence of guidelines on the review of pathology in the research context. A total of 219 surveys were sent electronically using Monkey Survey® (www.surveymonkey.com) and resent once to those who had not responded within 3 weeks. One question was designed to capture general information on the responders" laboratory practice and 8 questions gathered specific information on policies” (CAP-ACP, 2012, p. 3)
    “and practices relating to the issue of researcher requests for pathology materials and the management of revisions to diagnosis arising from that request or other activities e.g., tumor board reviews. All responses were anonymous. <U+F0B7> Surveys of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Organizations. The Royal College of Pathologists in the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, and the College of American Pathologists were surveyed by email and/or mail and asked the same 8 questions. <U+F0B7> Ethical and Legal Opinions. The Tricouncil Interagency in Research Ethics in Canada (The Tricouncil. www. pre.ethics.gc.ca) and the Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA. www. cmpa-acpm.org) were invited to review an earlier draft of the guideline and to provide written input. <U+F0B7> CAP-ACP executive committee and membership opinions. The executive committee of the CAP-ACP reviewed Draft #4. Their input was incorporated into Draft #5 and this was distributed to the membership who had a period of 2 months in which to provide written feedback.” (CAP-ACP, 2012, p. 4)

    “This paper provides an overview of the partnerships and joint projects that the Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada (IPC) has been engaged in over the years to operationalize Privacy by Design – providing concrete, meaningful operational effect to its principles. Informed by a broad collection of papers, it represents insights from a wide range of sectors, including telecommunications, health care, transportation, and energy. Further, it draws on the perspectives and experiences of executives, risk managers, lawyers and analysts, as well as engineers, designers, computer scientists and application developers, to name a few – all working to pursue privacy based on the principles of Privacy by Design. By reflecting on the experiences of others, it is my hope that privacy leaders will recognize an approach for their organizations to follow or be inspired to create one of their own. I also hope that, like the organizations highlighted here, new players will come forward to share their experiences, lessons learned, and accomplishments, arising through alignment of their organizations and operations with the principles of Privacy by Design, so that we may continue to build much-needed expertise, and grow best practices, for the benefit of all.” (Cavoukian, 2012, p. 5)

     Structured with:
    -        introduction (why need guidelines and method background)
    -        ethical issues for researchers (set out key issues) with example cases
    -        Practical approaches for research ethics committees – sets out key questions RECs might ask mostly
    -        Glossary
    - resources
    “The guidelines presented here have been developed to assist researchers who are conducting, and ethics committee members who are assessing, research involving digital data. Digital data presents researchers and ethics committees with familiar and novel ethical issues. Accepted strategies for managing issues such as privacy and confidentiality, and informed consent, need rethinking. The qualities of digital data, including its mobility and replicability, present new kinds of ethical issues which emerge in relation to data governance, data security and data management. This document has five parts. Part A discusses key features of digital data and explains how these guidelines were developed. Guidelines for researchers and human research ethics committees are presented in Parts B and C. Part B addresses researchers and discusses five categories of key ethical issues and poses related guiding questions to consider when conducting research involving digital data: • Consent • Privacy and confidentiality • Ownership and authorship • Data governance and custodianship • Data sharing: assessing the social benefits of research Part C addresses members of human research ethics committees and provides guiding questions for reviewing projects involving the use of digital data. The guidelines in Part B and C are formulated as discussions of key issues and arising questions. They are not intended to be prescriptive, but rather to contextualise and focus on key ethical risks in research involving digital data. Part D is a glossary of key terms used in the document. Part E lists resources that have informed the development of these guidelines and others which readers may find useful.” (Clark et al., 2015, p. 3)

    “researchers seek toengage communities, patients, and stakeholders as partners inthe process and products ofhealth research. However, there isno existing stakeholder-driven ethical framework for such engaged scholarship. We employed an iterative, stakeholder-engaged method todevelop adata-driven framework for the ethical review and conduct ofengaged scholarship. We used consensus development conference methods and amodified Delphi survey toengage 240 community members, ethicists, and academic researchers. This multi-staged process produced aframework with 4domains: vision of equitable and just research, relationship dynamics, community-informedrisk/benefits assessment, and accountability. Within the framework, 4cross-cutting considerations and 15 statements explicate the stakeholders’ priorities for the ethical review and conduct of engaged scholarship. Though the findings are promising, the study islimited inthat it focuses on stakeholder perspectives, but does not actually evaluate orapply the findings in the field. The stakeholder-engaged framework provides aplatform for further articulation of ethical practices and policy for engaged scholarship.” (Corbie-Smith et al., 2018, p. 1)

    “Acknowledgements: We are grateful for the participation and co-operation of the participants from the two ethics in visual research methods workshops, held in Melbourne, Australia and Wellington, New Zealand, which contributed to the development of these guidelines. We want to acknowledge the support of Ignacio Rojas and Assunta Hunter, project officers on this program. The insight and contributions of Cathy Vaughan and Erminia Colucci, co-leaders of the Visual Research Collaboratory, are gratefully acknowledged. We also greatly appreciate the useful and insightful comments and feedback of our colleagues in Australia and Canada who read and commented on the draft version of these guidelines. Finally, we acknowledge the financial contribution and support of the Melbourne Social Equity Institute, University of Melbourne.” (Cox et al., 2014, p. 2)
    “HOW THESE GUIDELINES WERE DEVELOPED In 2012 an interdisciplinary group of committed visual researchers working in Australia and Canada came together and formed the Visual Research Collaboratory (http://vrc. org.au/) with the goal of pooling our expertise and developing practical resources to support researchers using visual methods. This project, Enabling Socially Inclusive and Ethical Visual Methodologies, was developed by a group of members of the Visual Research Collaboratory as part of a 2013 Interdisciplinary Seed Grant through the Melbourne Social Equity Institute, at the University of Melbourne. In developing these guidelines, we ran a series of workshops and meetings, bringing together researchers with diverse interest and skills in a variety of forms of visual research. As a result of these discussions we identified a variety of ethical issues and practical concerns in visual research. We solicited a wide range of available resources, such as codes of conduct, human research ethics guidelines, and guidelines from relevant professional associations, relating specifically to visual methods. From these combined sources, we developed these guidelines as a resource for other visual researchers interested in developing a more ethically informed practice, and for human research ethics committees who approve visual research projects. Throughout the guidelines, quotations from researchers who participated in the workshops are used to illustrate issues. Interested researchers, practitioners and research ethics committee members kindly gave feedback on the guidelines to ensure their relevance and usefulness. We offer these guidelines as a work-inprogress, rather than as a definitive set of prescriptions. We are primarily social scientists, and therefore these guidelines reflect that. We invite your feedback and comments on the use of this guide and how it might be improved through the Visual Research Collaboratory website; we are particularly interested in engaging with researchers from other disciplines who face these issues.” (Cox et al., 2014, p. 6)

  note: "Structure:\n\nIntroduction - situates document with respect to target topic
    and connects the structure to audiences targeted.  Throughout the document ‘pull
    out’ quotes from researchers are used to highlight key provocations or themes
    related to ethics and visual methods.\n\n\nPart A: Overview - sets out with subheads,
    “What is visual research?”, “benefits of visual research”, “the need for guidelines
    for ethical visual research methods”, “how these guidelines were developed” (see
    ‘method’ tag)\n\n\nPart B: Considerations for Researchers - describes “Key ethical
    values informing visual research methods” (these are standard, respect, merit+integrity,justice,beneficence),
    six categories for ethical research using visual research methods “(1) confidentiality;
    (2) minimising harm; (3) consent; (4) fuzzy boundaries; (5) authorship and ownership;
    and (6) representation and audience/s. The first three categories refer to concepts
    that will be familiar to researchers. The other three categories may be less familiar,
    but are particularly relevant for visual research methods. The issues within these
    categories are inter-related and interlinked” (Cox et al., 2014, p. 8). These
    are stepped through with subheadings, “For each of these categories, we briefly
    define the ethical concept, highlight key ethical issues and identify a series
    of guiding questions that are designed to alert visual researchers to potential
    issues that need to be considered for ethical visual research practice. These
    questions are not meant to be exhaustive nor to work as a checklist, but rather
    to act as sensitising triggers for reflection.” (Cox et al., 2014, p. 8)\n\nConfidentiality
    (see above), highlights link to relevant legislation\n\n\nMinimising harm\n\n\nConsent\n\n\nFuzzy
    boundaries\n\n\nAuthorship and ownership\n\n\nRepresentation and audiences\n\n\n\nPart
    C: Practical Approaches for Research Ethics Committees: “Research ethics committee
    members may be unfamiliar with visual research methods and the key ethical issues
    arising from their use. This section of the guidelines distils six ways of proceeding
    that may be of assistance during ethics review and approval. These six areas are
    arranged in chronological order so that ethics committee members can incorporate
    them into the review process and identify areas where further input from the researcher
    and/or dialogue may be needed.” (Cox et al., 2014, p. 22)\n\nAcquiring necessary
    information about the proposed research \n\n\nAsking appropriate questions of
    the researcher\n\n\nincorporating participant perspectives\n\n\nidentifying strategies
    for handling ethical challenges\n\n\nlearning from experience\n\n\nproviding resources\n\n\n\nPart
    D: resources\n\n\n"

    “This document presents guidelines to assist researchers and research ethics committees in recognising and responding to ethical issues that arise from the use of visual research methods. The guidelines have been developed in recognition of the growing use of visual methods in research. Visual research methods present both familiar and novel ethical issues that are often amplified by the kinds of data collected in visual research, the processes used for data collection and dissemination, and the sensitive settings in which visual methods are frequently used. This document has four sections. Part A provides an overview of the field of visual research and explains how the guidelines were developed. Part B presents six categories of ethical issues for researchers to consider when using visual methods. Part C presents guidelines for human research ethics committees when considering visual research projects. The guidelines are not intended to be prescriptive; rather they identify critical questions that should be considered when developing and conducting studies using visual research methods. Finally, Part D lists resources that we have drawn on, and that users of these guidelines may find informative.” (Cox et al., 2014, p. 3)

    “My profound thanks to the members of the committee who have generously shared their time, expertise, and care through discussion and critical evaluation of the issues raised in this document.” (Ess and AoIR ethics working committee, 2002, p. 28)
    “Nonetheless, as we have worked through a wide range of issues, case studies, and pertinent literature, we are convinced that it is possible - up to a point, at least - to clarify and resolve at least many of the more common ethical difficulties. This document - as it synthesizes the results of our nearly two years’ of work together - is intended to aid both researchers from a variety of disciplines and those responsible for insuring that this research adhere to legal and ethical requirements in their work of clarifying and resolving ethical issues encounter in online research.” (Ess and AoIR ethics working committee, 2002, p. 3)

    “This document is addressed to Researchers, ethicists, and students in the social sciences and humanities, within the academic world and/or private and/or public research institutes, who study human inter/actions2 in the various venues made possible by the Internet; Organizations that commission, fund, or have oversight responsibility for Internet research (e.g., Institutional Review Boards in the United States; external Learning and Teaching Support Networks’ subject centres and internal Academic Standards and Policy committees in the United Kingdom; in Australia,3 the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Research Council [see <http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/issues/researchethics.htm>], etc. Academic societies and/or groups within the social sciences and humanities that promote and/or incorporate research concerning the Internet (e.g., the Japan Society for SocioInformation Studies (JSIS), <http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jsis/>, affiliated with the National Institute of Informatics, <http://www.nii.ac.jp/index.html>; the Information Ethics Group, Oxford Computing Laboratory <http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/ieg/>; and the International Center for Information Ethics (Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe, Germany) <http://icie.zkm.de/>, etc.)” (Ess and AoIR ethics working committee, 2002, p. 2)
    “This document represents a series of recommendations designed to support and inform those responsible for making decisions about the ethics of Internet research. It provides a resource for researchers, ethicists, and students by bringing together current discussion of important ethical issues and pertinent literature in the field. It can provide support for organisations and related groups that commission, fund or have overall responsibility for or an interest in Internet research practices in an international context and can be used to help inform any such bodies of the ethical issues that might be considered and possible ways of resolving ethical problems. [The committee - whose members represent eleven national cultures - is acutely aware that English, while currently the lingua franca of the Web, is but one of many languages in which important research and reflection takes place. As noted below, a central goal of this document is to present Internet research ethics that are intentionally pluralistic, first of all in order to preserve and foster the often diverse ethical insights of the world’s cultures. While the committee has attempted to develop a comprehensive overview of issues and resources in Internet research ethics - we would welcome suggestions for additions, especially from national cultures and in languages not well represented in the current document” (Ess and AoIR ethics working committee, 2002, p. 2)

    “The syllabus may be thought of as having three parts. The first unit introduces students to research ethics by considering the circumstances that have given rise to the requirement for ethical review of research and introducing some key principles and approaches to ethics that will provide a framework for later discussion of particular cases and ethical issues. The next five units form the core of the syllabus, each being focused on” (European Commission. Directorate-General for Research, 2010, p. 5)
    “a set of closely related ethical issues and/or types of research. The last two units address broader concerns that go beyond research itself, including the relationship between researchers and society and examples of how new biotechnologies can give rise to ethical issues that both exist independently of the research context and provide challenges to existing modes of ethical review. These units contain more, and more diverse, cases than the preceding ones, and may be thought of as extension materials to be drawn on as appropriate to the context of the course.” (European Commission. Directorate-General for Research, 2010, p. 6)

    “The syllabus presented here is designed for use in the training of researchers and research ethics committee members throughout the European Union and beyond. It is intended to be accessible to scientific and lay readers, including those with no previous experience of ethical theory and analysis. The syllabus will cover key issues in the ethics of research involving human participants, including the ethical issues associated with new technologies. The scope of the syllabus is the ethics of scientific research involving human beings. The case studies relate to a variety of scientific disciplines including biomedical and human life sciences, and the social sciences. Readers will be introduced to a range of philosophical perspectives and concepts, and these will be used to inform discussion of practical ethical issues, but without any particular approach being promoted. Similarly, reference will be made to major religious views where relevant (e.g. in relation to research involving human embryos), but without endorsing or rejecting any particular view. The syllabus consists of eight ‘units of study’ corresponding to the chapters of the textbook, each of which will include a list of intended learning outcomes for that unit, a brief overview of the topic to be addressed in the unit, one or more case studies each with a set of questions to guide discussion by students, descriptions of the main issues that should be discussed arising out of the case studies, and (where appropriate) identification of further issues for discussion that may not arise directly out of the case studies but are related to the themes of the unit. The intention is that an instructor should be able to use the intended learning outcomes and overview in planning the course and introducing the topics to students; the case studies and associated questions can be used either as a basis for small group discussion within the classroom or as preparatory work; and the descriptions of the main issues can be used by the instructor as a basis for guiding and responding to the discussions.” (European Commission. Directorate-General for Research, 2010, p. 5)

    “This syllabus is the second output of the project “EU Textbook on Ethics in Research”, funded by the European Commission and delivered by members of the Centre for Professional Ethics at Keele University. As an accompaniment to the principal output of the project, which is the textbook itself, this syllabus provides an overview of the content of the textbook and is designed to be used as a basis for training courses in research ethics aimed at researchers and/or research ethics committee members and officers. The textbook itself contains the same case studies as the syllabus, but with more detailed discussion of the ethical issues arising from them. Ideally the syllabus will be used in conjunction with the textbook, but it may also be used independently, in which case the guides to further reading provided at the end of each unit will be of particular importance.” (European Commission. Directorate-General for Research, 2010, p. 5)

    “I am grateful for the valuable contribution of the Expert Group set up by the European Commission to the preparation of these Guidelines. This group brought together a wide range of experts: from practitioners to researchers in AI, data, ethics and education, as well as representatives of various international organisations, such as UNICEF, UNESCO and OECD. The Expert Group offered rich knowledge and expertise building on the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and The Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI), areas that have been already high on EU’s political agenda. Focusing on both the ethics of education and the ethics of AI and Data, the Group also took into account the proposed legal framework for AI (Artificial Intelligence Act), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the proposals for a Data Act and for an EU Declaration on digital rights and principles.” (European Commission, 2022, p. 6)

    “I am pleased to share with you the present Ethical Guidelines on the use of AI and data in teaching and learning for educators. The Guidelines will undoubtedly help our teachers and educators reflect on how they can use AI and data in their daily practices – and empower them to act accordingly.” (European Commission, 2022, p. 6)
    “hese Guidelines are to be used in schools across Europe and we shall actively promote them through the Erasmus+ programme. Collectively or individually, teachers and school leaders will now have a solid basis to venture out and expand their use of these technologies in a considerate, safe and ethical way. These Guidelines, along with their use on the ground, are fundamental to our ongoing efforts to achieve the European Education Area, while supporting the work being carried out by EU Member States. The Guidelines are part of a longer journey, while the EU is negotiating and preparing for a comprehensive and effective regulatory framework for trustworthy AI, to be implemented across all sectors in the EU, including education. And our work does not stop here. As we move forward, we will continue to develop a better understanding of how to apply these technologies, allowing educators to be even more inclusive and pragmatic, especially in primary and secondary education” (European Commission, 2022, p. 6)
    “AND DATA IN TEACHING AND LEARNING FOR EDUCATORS 7 Therefore, I would invite all European teachers and educators to take advantage of these guidelines, and to share their feedback on their practical application and experience, as this will support our ongoing efforts regarding the digital transition in education. We shall also strongly benefit from the views and experience of our pupils, their families, and all stakeholders in the field of education about the use and impact of AI in their daily work and how to make it further beneficial while avoiding risks and negative effects to human rights and our fundamental EU values. Our joint work on AI and data in education shows a shared commitment to the education community, to our learners, to their development and well-being. These Guidelines are an important starting point. It is now up to all of us to promote them and put them into practice. I am counting on you.” (European Commission, 2022, p. 7)

    “This new Taylor Institute Guide takes the researcher through the essentials of the Canadian standards for ethical practice in the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL). It began with Lisa Fedoruk’s review of the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS2, 2014), which expanded and clarified the highest level best practices necessary for the scholarship done at Canadian post-secondary institutions across Canada. Because of the unique challenges of SoTL, where the human participants that are the subject of the research are also typically the researcher’s students, this Guide translates the comprehensive TCPS2 (2014) for the researcher conducting SoTL research. Of note, a 2018 summary of revisions to the TCPS2 can be found here. The team at the Taylor Institute wanted to provide a guide that laid bare the potential hegemony and power relationships that are part of instruction in higher education. In addition to a careful extrapolation of the relevant principles from the TCPS2, the author integrated several important findings from the scholarly literature on research ethics and SoTL. Next, input was sought from a Research Ethics Senior Advisor at the Secretariat on Responsible Conduct of Research with the Government of Canada. By including practical strategies for ethical practice in SoTL, the unique challenges that compliance with the TCPS2 poses for SoTL are brought to life. The work was then sent out to a community of Canadian academic researchers for their feedback and contributions (see previous page for the list of contributors). The result is a collaboration between a broad diversity of experts reflecting the insights of ethical researchers and ethics board members and chairs from across the country, to provide a resource to complement researchers’ own ethical practices, training, and sound judgement as they conduct their scholarship of teaching and learning. Research with human participants is complex. Just as the TCPS2 supports researchers in managing that complexity, we hope that this Guide will be helpful to SoTL researchers in their design process so that their research projects will be sound and robust, and the resulting insights can inform and extend our understanding of the processes of learning and of supporting that learning with effective, evidence-based instruction” (Fedoruk, 2017, p. 1)

    “If you are a student, you may find the 2002 guidelines (IRE 2.0) a good starting point of reflection. If you are looking for a draft to obtain informed consent, look into the appendix of the 2002 guidelines (IRE 1.0, https://aoir.org/reports/ethics.pdf; IRE 2.0, https://aoir.org/reports/ethics2.pdf). If you are a researcher, you might want to begin with the 2019 guidelines to see if the provided resources are a helpful starting point. If you are looking for ways to solve the issue of informed consent you might want to have a look into the appendices of the 2002 document. A catalogue of important questions to start with can be found in the 2012 guidelines. For additional information, especially that focuses on recent technological developments, you might find the 2019 document a useful. Especially political and institutional pressure on researcher has gained importance. If you are an IRB, Ethical Review Board, or member of a similar research ethics oversight board, we highly encourage you to take a look into the 3.0 guidelines. Notice that we emphasize deliberative processes of ethical reflection. At the same time, we believe that in times of Big Data, experimental research needs to be done that requires considerations beyond informed consent, but further includes careful reflection on research design, the context of research, and the basic requirement to minimize associated risks and harms. An ongoing ethical reflection might be more helpful and beneficial in the long term for society than now restricting research. If you are a developer, you might find it helpful to have a closer look into the Companion Resources (6.0). These include “AI and Machine Learning: Internet Research Ethics Guidelines” (6.1) and an “Impact Model” (6.4) for ethical reflection which may be helpful” (franzke et al., 2020, p. 2)

    “The Association of Internet Researchers has foregrounded the development of Internet Research Ethics (IRE) since its inception. A first set of IRE guidelines was developed, approved by the AoIR membership, and published in 2002 (Ess and the AoIR ethics working committee). These guidelines – referred to here as IRE 1.0 – achieved broad acceptance and use internationally, in both diverse research communities as well as in U.S. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), U.K. Ethical Review Boards, and their institutional counterparts and national data agencies in other countries (Buchanan & Ess, 2008). In response to new technological developments, including the emergence of Social Networking Sites (from ca. 2005), the mobility revolution (i.e., dramatic expansion of internet access by way of mobile phones and devices, ca. 2008), and the initial emergence of Big Data, a second set of guidelines (IRE 2.0) were developed and published in 2012 (Markham” (franzke et al., 2020, p. 3)
    “& Buchanan). While dramatically expanding and refining the first set of guidelines (IRE 1.0), the second set of guidelines, IRE 2.0, is explicitly rooted in and builds upon the first set.” (franzke et al., 2020, p. 4)

    Hudson, M., Milne, M., Russell, K., Smith, B., Reynolds, P., & Atatoa-Carr, P. (2016). The development of guidelines for indigenous research ethics in Aotearoa/New Zealand. In A. L. Drugge (Ed.), Ethics in Indigenous Research, Past Experiences – Future Challenges (pp. 157–174). Vaartoe Centre for Sami Research, Umea University. https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/handle/10289/12195

    Identification of key underpinning purpose for the guidelines: “(1) to explain key ethical concepts for Maori; (2) to support decision-making around Maori ethical issues; (3) to identify ways to address Maori ethical concerns; and (4) to clarify the roles of Maori ethics committee members” (Hudson et al., 2016, p. 161)
     
    “Structure of the Framework We considered the dynamics of the engagement space between researchers and the community and oriented the framework around four key questions that we thought a Maori community would ask of researchers. • He aha te whakapapa o tenei kaupapa? / How did this project come about? • Kei a wai te mana mo tenei kaupapa? / Who is in charge of the project? • Me pehea e tika ai tenei kaupapa? / Will it produce the intended outcomes? • Ma wai e manaaki tenei kaupapa? Who looks out for the peoples interests?” (Hudson et al., 2016, p. 162)
    Providing space for cross-cutting concepts drawn particularly from Maori knowledge and Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.
    Identified ethical issues from existing policy, articles, and guidelines and aligned these to Maori values.
    Undertook consultation with stakeholder groups

  note: "Structure:\nThe document is 294 pages, which makes it challenging to navigate.
    The subheadings in the contents (p.3) don’t match the section numbers and headings
    throughout the document clearly. \n\nEAD1e_00_front_matter - Introduction - situates
    need with respect to target topic and intended purpose/use of resource\n\n\nExecutive
    Summary - Sets out purpose of document and overview of structure, including key
    ethics principles (see quote), ethical foundations, areas of impact for AI, and
    implementation of ethics in the field. “1. Human Rights A/IS shall be created
    and operated to respect, promote, and protect internationally recognized human
    rights. 2. Well-being A/IS creators shall adopt increased human well-being as
    a primary success criterion for development. 3. Data Agency A/IS creators shall
    empower individuals with the ability to access and securely share their data,
    to maintain people’s capacity to have control over their identity. 4. Effectiveness
    A/IS creators and operators shall provide evidence of the effectiveness and fitness
    for purpose of A/IS. 5. Transparency The basis of a particular A/IS decision should
    always be discoverable. 6. Accountability A/IS shall be created and operated to
    provide an unambiguous rationale for all decisions made. 7. Awareness of Misuse
    A/IS creators shall guard against all potential misuses and risks of A/IS in operation.
    8. Competence A/IS creators shall specify and operators shall adhere to the knowledge
    and skill required for safe and effective operation.” (Chatila and Havens, 2019,
    p. 4)\n\n\nAcknowledgements - \n\n\nEthically aligned design (top-level)\n\nFrom
    Principles to Practice: Ethically aligned design conceptual framework, “provides
    a mapping of the conceptual framework of Ethically Aligned Design. It outlines
    the logic behind “Three Pillars” that form the basis of EAD1e, and it connects
    the Pillars to high-level “General Principles” which guide all manner of ethical
    A/IS design. Following this, the content of the Chapters of EAD1e is mapped to
    the Principles. Finally, examples of EAD1e already in practice are described.”
    (Chatila and Havens, 2019, p. 9)\n\nThree pillars - universal human values, political
    self determination and data agency, and technical dependability. Outlined.\n\n\nThe
    general principles of ethically aligned design - as in executive summary quote.
    \n\n\nMapping the pillars to the principles - maps 3 pillars to 8 principles,
    and then to chapters in the guidance. Gives some high level overview of implementation.\n\n\n\nGeneral
    principles - sets out each principle, with background including links to international
    law, recommendations, and further resources\n\n\nClassical Ethics in A/IS - outlines
    ethical theories for A/IS, including virtue, deontological, consequentialist,
    ethics of care, and recommendations.  Then sets out some example theoretical issues
    and recommendations, e.g. “The distinction between agents and patients” (or, anthropomorphising
    autonomy in AI), “the need for accessible, classical ethics vocabulary”, “presenting
    ethics to the creators of autonomous and intelligent systems” (how to connect
    to technical practice), “Accessing classical ethics by corporations and companies”
    (same, but at organisational level), “the impact of automated systems on the workplace”
    (need to operationalise and develop practical tools)\n\n\nSection 2 - Classical
    ethics from globally diverse traditions - sets out monopoly on ethics by Western
    ethical traditions, then uses similar structure above, with issues and recommendations:
    “Application of classical Buddhist ethical traditions” (ethics as relational),
    “Application of Ubuntu”; “Application of Shinto-inspired ethics”. \n\n\nSection
    3 - Classical Ethics for a Technical World - Sets out issues, with background,
    recommendations, and resources. Issues: “Maintaining human autonomy”; “implications
    of a cultural migration in A/IS”; “Applying goal-directed behaviour (virtual ethics)
    to A/IS”; “A requirement for rule-based ethics in practical programming”; \n\n\nWellbeing
    - sets out possible impact of A/IS on wellbeing, “This chapter is divided into
    two main sections: • The Value of Well-being Metrics for A/IS Creators • Implementing
    Well-being Metrics for A/IS Creators” (Chatila and Havens, 2019, p. 69). Definition,
    backhround, key issues, and practical resources and recommendations are provided.
    A number of issues are stepped through as above. The same structure is used for
    both subsections.\n\n\nAffective computing - as above\n“addresses issues related
    to emotions and emotionlike control in interactions between humans and design
    of A/IS. We have put forward recommendations on a variety of topics: considering
    how affect varies across human cultures; the particular problems of artifacts
    designed for caring and private relationships; considerations of how intelligent
    artifacts may be used for “nudging”; how systems can support human flourishing;
    and appropriate policy interventions for artifacts designed with inbuilt affective
    systems. Document Sections • Section 1—Systems Across Cultures • Section 2—When
    Systems Care • Section 3—System Manipulation/Nudging/Deception • Section 4—Systems
    Supporting Human Potential • Section 5—Systems with Synthetic Emotions” (Chatila
    and Havens, 2019, p. 90)\n\n\nPersonal Data and Individual Agency - again, issues,
    background, recommendations, and resources. \n“we recommend governments and organizations:
    • Create: Provide every individual with the means to create and project their
    own terms and conditions regarding their personal data that can be read and agreed
    to at a machinereadable level. • Curate: Provide every individual with a personal
    data or algorithmic agent which they curate to represent their terms and conditions
    in any real, digital, or virtual environment. • Control: Provide every individual
    access to services allowing them to create a trusted identity to control the safe,
    specific, and finite exchange of their data. Three sections of this chapter reflect
    these core ideals regarding human agency. A fourth section addresses issues surrounding
    personal data and individual agency relating to children.” (Chatila and Havens,
    2019, p. 110)\n\n\n\nMethods to guide ethical research and design - \n“researchers,
    product developers, and technologists across all sectors need to embrace research
    and development methods that evaluate their processes, products, values, and design
    practices in light of the concerns and considerations raised in this chapter.
    This chapter is split up into three sections: Section 1—Interdisciplinary Education
    and Research Section 2—Corporate Practices on A/IS Section 3—Responsibility and
    Assessment Each of the sections highlights various areas of concern (issues) as
    well as recommendations and further resources. Overall, we address both structural
    and individual approaches.” (Chatila and Havens, 2019, p. 124)\n\n\nA/IS for sustainable
    development - \n“This chapter explores the imperative for A/IS to serve humanity
    by improving the quality and standard of life for all people everywhere. It makes
    recommendations for advancing equal access to this transformative technology,

    “This document was developed by The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems, which is an authorized Industry Connections activity within the IEEE Standards Association, a Major Organizational Unit of IEEE. It was prepared using an open, collaborative, and consensus building approach, following the processes of the Industry Connections framework program of the IEEE Standards Association (standards.ieee. org/industry-connections). This process does not necessarily incorporate all comments or reflect the views of every contributor listed in the Acknowledgements above or after each chapter of this work. The views and opinions expressed in this collaborative work are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of their respective institutions or of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). This work is published under the auspices of The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems for the purposes of furthering public understanding of the importance of addressing ethical considerations in the design of autonomous and intelligent systems. In no event shall IEEE or IEEE-SA Industry Connections Activity Members be liable for any errors, omissions or damage, direct or otherwise, however caused, arising in any way out of the use of or application of any recommendation contained in this publication. The Board of Governors of the IEEE Standards Association, its highest governing body, commends the consensus-building process used in developing Ethically Aligned Design, First Edition, and offers the work for consideration and guidance in the ethical development of autonomous and intelligent systems.” (Chatila and Havens, 2019, p. 290)
    “Our Process To ensure the greatest cultural relevance and intellectual rigor possible in our work, The IEEE Global Initiative has sought for and received global feedback for versions 1 and 2 (after hundreds of experts created first drafts) to inform this Ethically Aligned Design, First Edition (E AD1e). We released Ethically Aligned Design, Version 1 (E AD v1) as a Request for Input in December of 2016 and received over two hundred pages of in-depth feedback about the draft. We subsequently released Ethically Aligned Design, Version 2 (EADv2) in December 2017 and received over three hundred pages of in-depth feedback about the draft. This feedback included further insights about the eight original sections from EADv1, along with unique/new input for the five new sections included in EADv2. Both versions included “candidate recommendations” instead of direct “recommendations”, because our communities had been engaged in debate and weighing various options. This process was taken to the next level with Ethically Aligned Design, First Edition (EAD1e), using EADv1 and EADv2 as its initial foundation. Although we expect future editions of Ethically Aligned Design, a vetting process has taken place within the global community that gave rise to this seminal work. Therefore, we can now speak of “recommendations” without any further restriction, and E AD1e also includes a set of policy recommendations. This process included matters of “internal consistency” across the various chapters of E AD1e and also more specific or broader criteria, such as maturity of the specific chapters and consistency with respect to policy statements of IEEE. The review also considered the need for IEEE to maintain a neutral-and thus credibleposition in areas and processes where it is likely that IEEE may become active in the future. Beyond these formal procedures, the Board of Governors of IEEE Standards Association has endorsed the work of the IEEE Global Initiative and offers it for consideration by governments, businesses, and the public at large with the following resolution: Whereas the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems is an authorized activity within the IEEE Standards Association Industry Connections program created with the stated mission: To ensure every stakeholder involved in the design and development of autonomous and intelligent systems is educated, trained, and empowered to prioritize ethical considerations so that these technologies are advanced for the benefit of humanity; Whereas versions 1 and 2 of Ethically Aligned Design: A Vision for Prioritizing Human Wellbeing with Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS) were developed as calls for comment and candidate recommendations by several hundred professionals including engineers, scientists,” (Chatila and Havens, 2019, p. 288)
    “ethicists, sociologists, economists, and many others from six continents; Whereas the recommendations contained in Ethically Aligned Design: A Vision for Prioritizing Human Well-being with Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS), First Edition are the result of the consideration of hundreds of comments submitted by professionals and the public at large on versions 1 and 2; Whereas through an extensive, global, and open collaborative process, more than a thousand experts of The IEEE Global Initiative have developed and are in the process of final editing and publishing Ethically Aligned Design: A Vision for Prioritizing Human Well-being with Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS), First Edition; now, therefore, be it Resolved, that the IEEE Standards Association Board of Governors: 1. expresses its appreciation to the leadership and members of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems for the creation of Ethically Aligned Design: A Vision for Prioritizing Human Well-being with Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS), First Edition; and 2. supports and commends the collaborative process used by The IEEE Global Initiative to achieve extraordinary consensus in such complex and vast matters in less than three years; and 3. endorses and offers Ethically Aligned Design: A Vision for Prioritizing Human Well-being with Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS), First Edition to businesses, governments and the public at large for consideration and guidance in the ethical development of autonomous and intelligent systems. Terminology Update For Ethically Aligned Design, we prefer not to use—as far as possible—the vague term “AI” and use instead the term, autonomous and intelligent systems (or A/IS). Even so, it is inherently difficult to define “intelligence” and “autonomy”. One could, however, limit the scope for practical purposes to computational systems using algorithms and data to address complex problems and situations, including the capability of improving their performance based on evaluating previous decisions, and say that such systems could be considered as “intelligent”. Such systems could be regarded also as “autonomous” in a given domain as long as they are capable of accomplishing their tasks despite environment changes within the given domain. This terminology is applied throughout Ethically Aligned Design, First Edition to ensure the broadest possible application of ethical considerations in the design of the addressed technologies and systems.” (Chatila and Havens, 2019, p. 289)

    “The Collective Strategy Used for Producing this Publication: Academics and practitioners, who had actively carried out research with children aged five to 8 years, were identified and asked to join a network of experts. These experts represented a range of academic and professional fields, including: streetwork, playwork, social work, childhood studies, education, psychology, counseling, sociology, and anthropology and geography. An initial meeting of experts took place in The Hague in June 2013. Experts attended from Canada, Iceland, India, Malaysia, Nepal, Peru, South Africa, Uganda, the UK, and the USA. A draft literature review and framework for the gathering and analysis of methods was prepared in advance of this meeting by the research team. This framework was then further developed and built upon during workshop sessions at the meeting. During the workshop sessions the experts considered methods they had used in practice, identified the benefits and challenges of these methods and developed key messages to include in this resource. In addition to the work of those experts in attendance the group also considered the work of others in the field. Templates were designed to gather further examples of methods of value in working with young children. These templates were piloted by researchers working in South Africa and India before being shared with experts living and working in a variety of global contexts. This included researchers working in Australia, Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Through this broad sweep in the collection of methods we have been able to gather methods that have been successfully used in research with young children for a wide range of types of research questions and in a very broad range of contexts. This has enabled us to identify some of the many important kinds of cultural, religious and resource issues that one needs to consider when working with children in very different kinds of settings. We have also included case studies to show how the research methods have has been applied in different parts of the world. These case studies enable us to illustrate that the methods described in this set of resources should not be simply copied; research design should involve the creative selection, combining and modifying of methods if it is to be safe, engaging, productive and relevant to children’s lives.” (“Steps for Engaging Young Children in Research Volume 1: The Guide”, 2014, p. 8)

    “The Structure of this Resource:
    ‘Steps to Engaging Young Children in Research’ is split into a Researcher Resource and a Researcher Toolkit. These have been developed to assist researchers to design research which is ethical, sensitive to the needs of the children, the community in which they live, whilst also being engaging for young children. These steps suggest an initial process of reviewing capabilities, developing ethical protocols and building trust and relationships.
    This Researcher Resource provides academic background about why young children should be involved in research and provides more guidance on each of the six steps to engaging young children in research. For each of the steps guidance is given about what the researcher might include in their research when considering each step.
    For each cluster of methods an overview is provided to show the range of the types of methods that could be applied with young children, key strengths and weaknesses of these methods and a consideration of the potential contextual, ethical and capacity issues which may arise through the use of such methods INTRODUCTION TO THE RESEARCHER TOOLKIT AND RESOURC” (“Steps for Engaging Young Children in Research Volume 1: The Guide”, 2014, p. 8)
    “Steps to Engaging Young Children in Research Case Studies of Learning from Practice are included in this Researcher Resource to demonstrate research processes have been applied with young children around the world. These demonstrate the adaptation and combination of methods that have been applied to answer particular research questions in different contexts. These examples are not meant to be prescriptive, but to give researchers examples from particular settings and to demonstrate the complexity of engaging young children in research. The examples include understanding: requirements in early childhood education in Ethiopia; wellbeing/ illbeing in Peru; work and household roles, Child Clubs and perceptions in early childhood in Nepal; street connectedness in India; moving from kindergarten to primary school in Iceland. The accompanying Researcher Toolkit encourages researchers planning to work with young children to consider not only the types of methods needed to answer different research questions, but also the context in which the methods are to be applied and the skills that will be required to use them. Detailed methods discussed include clay modeling in South Africa, the use of medical dolls in Canada, child-led tours around slums in India, and drawing ecograms and wearing alien masks in Scotland. A collection of methods provides a number of examples of methods successfully used in research with young children. This will support researchers to identify and trial different methods in their context to answer their research questions. The methods presented have been divided into six separate, though interlinking, clusters: • Gaining Consent and Developing Trust • Interviews and Discussion • Child-led Tours and in-Situ • Visual Free Expression • Structured Visuals • Drama and Performance • Play and Games This Researcher Toolkit is presented as guidance rather than as a ‘how-to guide’ to be strictly followed. Each research problem is unique, each group of children will have different needs and abilities and as such researchers need access to a variety of methods that can be applied flexibly, modified, and combined in different ways to provide a unique research design. Many questions are raised for researchers to consider as they engage in this creative process of design. Collaboration with other researchers is encouraged. In doing so, if researchers continue to share their progress and extend ideas, then a community of practice of those engaging young children in research can be expanded and strengthened. Detailed descriptions of how methods have been applied in different contexts are included in the Researcher Toolkit. These show how methods have been applied in a range of countries and settings so that researchers can get ideas of innovative tools and how they may be suited to their needs.” (“Steps for Engaging Young Children in Research Volume 1: The Guide”, 2014, p. 9)
    Step 2 re ethics sets out some clear very specific issues that should (in all cases) or could (depending on the research) be considered, with examples of practical guidance.
    In considering each method (step 5) an “ethics and context” section provides some specific elaboration for that method and examples of research that might be drawn on
    In the case studies (p.67 on)- which give examples of research conducted - “ethical considerations” are set out briefly.

    “The first version of the AoIR Ethical Decision-Making document was released in 2002, after two years of international and cross-disciplinary collaboration. The document and its guidelines emerged from a series of extensive dialogues among experienced researchers facing and resolving ethical issues in internet research, philosophers, and other members of AoIR's international, interdisciplinary community. The intention was to develop guidelines from the bottom up -- i.e., out of the day-to-day practices of researchers in a wide range of disciplines, countries and contexts, in contrast to a more usual top-down approach that tries to provide a universal set of norms, principles, practices, and regulations. This approach was crucial because the enterprise of internet research is expansive -- that is, globally informed -- but also situated in innumerable locales. The 2002 document has subsequently received much use, and has been cited and used in a wide range of publications by a diverse number of disciplines. The AoIR Guidelines document has also been used by research ethics boards (REBs) and institutional review boards (IRBs) when making decisions about internet research-based protocols.” (Markham and Buchanan, p. 2)

    “This document aligns with and extends the first AoIR document. This document represents a series of considerations designed to support and inform those responsible for making decisions about the ethics of internet research. And, while primarily directed at researchers, it provides a resource for a wide audience of other stakeholders such as review boards, ethicists, and students, by providing a current discussion of important ethical issues and pertinent literature in the field” (Markham and Buchanan, p. 2)

    “Methods: We developed a series of six weekly workshops called “Research 101.” These workshops brought together approximately 13 representatives from peer-based organizations in the The Downtown Eastside (DTES) with a variety of experiences with research. Research 101 created space for community members themselves to discuss the pitfalls and potential of research in their neighborhood and to express community expectations for more ethical and respectful research. Results: We summarized workshop discussions in a co-authored “Manifesto for Ethical Research in the Downtown Eastside.” This document serves as a resource to empower community organizations to develop more equitable partnerships with researchers and help researchers ground their work in the principles of locally developed “community ethics.” Manifesto guidelines include increased researcher transparency, community-based ethical review of projects, empowering peer researchers in meaningful roles within a research project, and taking seriously the need for reciprocity in the research exchange.” (Neufeld et al., 2019, p. 1)
    “Six workshops took place [… including…]  time for each participant around the circle to check in and respond to an initial prompt related to the weekly topic (e.g., What is a positive or negative experience you have had with research?). Following this, SN would provide some brief context on the weekly topic (e.g., describing the usual process of a university ethical review and how some scholars have critiqued the suitability of university REBs for assessing the ethics of community-based research), taking care to translate academic jargon into language everyone could understand, and then pose several questions to stimulate discussion. Participants were encouraged to share stories of how the aspect of research under discussion that week could, in their experience, “go wrong.”” (Neufeld et al., 2019, p. 4)
    “Content for each of the six workshops was informed by critical academic literature on ethics in communitybased research and developed by SN in consultation with DTES community partners. Weekly themes were roughly based on the unique ethical issues that arise at different stages of a typical community-based research project.” (Neufeld et al., 2019, p. 4)
    “We also discussed possibilities for what we could create together as a way of summarizing the work of Research 101 and agreed at that point to create a “Manifesto for Ethical Research in the DTES.”” (Neufeld et al., 2019, p. 4)
    “At the sixth and final workshop, SN brought hard copies of a rough draft of the “Manifesto” (based on LD’s weekly notes from workshops one to five) which were distributed to each participant and discussed as a group, line by line to arrive at a collaboratively produced edited draft of the Manifesto. In our concluding conversation on this final day, we also discussed our unifying goal of sharing the work of Research 101 and the Manifesto as widely as possible” (Neufeld et al., 2019, p. 5)
    “The Manifesto’s guidelines for what constitutes ethical research from the perspective of DTES community members are then positioned as a way for researchers to learn how to improve their ethical practice when working in the neighborhood.” (Neufeld et al., 2019, p. 5)
    “A brief outline of the four primary sections of the Manifesto follows, closely mirroring weeks two to five of the Research 101 workshops and tracing the progression of a typical research project that might unfold in the community. The first section, “Getting to Know Each Other” deals with the issue of researcher transparency, especially in the early stages of setting up a potential research partnership, and provides a series of pointed questions to ask researchers about their identities and motivations for doing the research. The second section, “Ethical Review: Whose Ethics?” describes some of the limitations of university-based REBs in evaluating ethics applications for community-based research in the DTES. It also introduces the idea of a “Community Research Ethics Board” (CREB) based on the DTES that could enable community members themselves to review researchers’ ethics applications, an idea that is fleshed out in more detail with a series of recommendations for what this could look like in the context of the DTES. In the third section, “Doing the Research: Power and ‘Peers’” we summarize the many ways in which the positive development of researchers increasingly engaging “peer” researchers in their projects can go awry, and how this can be avoided. A final section on “Reciprocity and Bringing the Research Back” describes how infrequent and inadequate researchers’ attempts at knowledge translation or reciprocal exchange often are and how researchers could move beyond mere knowledge translation and begin to consider what true reciprocity might look like if community benefits from the research were equal to the benefits for researchers. The Manifesto concludes with a brief description of ways in which individuals and organizations can support the work of Research 101 and the Manifesto” (Neufeld et al., 2019, p. 5)

  note: "From the document itself:\n“This report gives a considered and cohesive overview
    of the current state of play of data-driven technologies within the health and
    care system, covering everything from the local research environment to international
    frameworks in development. Informed by research conducted by NHSX and other partners
    over the past year, it outlines where in the system AI technologies can be utilised
    and the policy work that is, and will need to be done, to ensure this utilisation
    is done in a safe, effective and ethically acceptable manner. Specifically:” (NHSx,
    2019, p. 6)\n\n“Chapters 1 and 2 set the scene. They provide an overview of what
    AI is (and importantly is not), why we believe it is important, and a detailed
    look at what is currently being developed by the AI ecosystem by evaluating the
    results of a horizon scanning exercise and our second ‘State of the Nation’ survey.
    This analysis reveals that diagnosis and screening are the most common uses of
    AI, with 132 different AI products identified being designed for diagnosis or
    screening purposes covering 70 different conditions” (NHSx, 2019, p. 6)\n\n\n“Chapter
    3 is an in-depth look at the Governance of AI. Building on the Code of Conduct
    for data-driven technologies, it explores the development of a novel governance
    framework that emphasises both the softer ethical considerations of the “should
    vs should not” in the development of AI solutions as well as the more legislative
    regulations of “could vs could not”. In particular it covers key areas such as
    the explainability of an algorithm, the evidence generation for efficacy of fixed
    algorithms, the importance of patient safety and what to consider in commercial
    strategies.” (NHSx, 2019, p. 6)\n\n\n“Chapter 4 is all about the data that fuels
    AI. When engaging with innovators, regulators, commissioners and citizens on AI
    the one topic that is guaranteed to come up is Information Governance (IG). Protecting
    patient data is of the utmost importance, which is why IG is crucial, but it should
    not be seen as a blocker to the use of data for purposes that can deliver genuine
    benefits to patients, clinicians and the system. This Chapter highlights how we
    are working collaboratively with key partners across the system (e.g. the Accelerated
    Access Collaborative, the Office of Life Sciences, Health Data Research UK, Genomics
    England, Academic Health Science Network) to clarify the rules of IG and streamline
    access to data for good through specific programmes such as the Digital Innovation
    Hubs.\n\n\nChapter 5 covers adoption and spread. Considering the sometimes negative
    impact the complexity of the NHS as a sociotechnical system has on the spread
    of important innovation, it covers the actions being taken to encourage adoption.
    However, given the challenges involved in the practical implementation of AI we
    do not want to encourage adoption for the sake of adoption, so it also covers
    ‘what good looks like’ and how we can monitor the impact of the introduction of
    AI over time so that good stays good further downstream.\n\n\nChapter 6 comes
    back to the people of the NHS. Building on the work of Health Education England
    and the Topol Review, it highlights the challenges faced by the workforce in the
    development, deployment and use of AI and what needs to be done in order to ensure
    they have the skills that they need to feel confident in using AI in clinical
    practice safely and effectively. Crucially it highlights how again we cannot do
    this alone and must work closely with national centres of data science training
    such as the Alan Turing Institute.” (NHSx, 2019, p. 7)\n\n\n“Chapter 7 goes international.
    Health data is not only generated in England and the AI technologies that are
    trained and tested on it are not developed only in England. Instead the AI ecosystem
    is truly international and there is, therefore, a need for international collaboration
    and agreement of standards, frameworks and guidance. For this reason, this chapter
    highlights the ongoing work of the Global Digital Health Partnership, the World
    Health Organisation and the EQUATOR network in developing these with us as a key
    partner.\n\n\nChapter 8 concludes with the NHS AI Lab. It brings together all
    the information included in the previous chapters to highlight why we know that
    the Lab is needed and why we think it will be crucial in helping us achieve our
    aims of: • promoting the UK as the best place in the world to invest in healthtech.
    • providing evidence of what good practice looks like to industry and commissioners.
    • reassuring the public, patients and clinicians that data-driven technology is
    safe, effective and protects privacy. • allowing the government to work with suppliers
    to guide the development of new technology so products are suitable for the health
    and care system in the future. • building capability within the system with In-house
    expertise to prototype and develop ideas. • making sure the NHS gets a fair deal
    from the commercialisation of its data resources and expertise.” (NHSx, 2019,
    p. 7)\n\nEthics coverage sets out key principles, and how they may be implemented.

    Per abstract: “As interest in autism in adulthood grows, so does the need for methods to promote the inclusion of autistic adults in research. Our objective was to create practice-based guidelines for the inclusion of autistic adults, both as research team members and as study participants. We conducted an institutional ethnography of three closely related research partnerships that used participatory methods with autistic adults over the years 2006–2018. We used an iterative approach which combined discussions with community and academic partners and artifact review. Guidelines to promote the inclusion of autistic adults as co-researchers focus on being transparent about partnership goals, clearly defining roles and choosing partners, creating processes for effective communication and power-sharing, building and maintaining trust, disseminating findings, encouraging community capacitation, and fairly compensating partners. Guidelines to promote the inclusion of autistic adults as study participants focus on maximizing autonomy and inclusion, creating an accessible consent process, offering multiple modes of participation, adapting survey instruments for use with autistic adults, creating accessible qualitative interview guides, and handling data from proxy reporters. Although these practice-based guidelines may not apply to all research teams, we hope that other researchers can capitalize on these practical lessons when including autistic adults in research.” (Nicolaidis et al., 2019, page 1)

    “This edition of the British Psychological Society Code of Human Research Ethics has been substantially revised and updated from the 2014 edition. Although the changes reflect developments in the field of research ethics, the basic Principles remain unchanged. This new version is intended, as were previous editions, to help psychology researchers to engage actively in identifying, analysing and addressing the range of ethics issues that are pertinent for their particular projects. While many issues are perennial, and this Code seeks to identify these and provide guidance in how to satisfactorily manage them, new research topics and methods are constantly generating new ethics challenges. So this Code also seeks to engender a mode of thinking that will enable researchers to competently and confidently approach carrying out their investigations in ethically sound ways. In addition, this Code sets out the Society’s expectations for how ethics review is best conducted so that participants can be assured that any research they take part in has been properly scrutinised.” (Oates et al., 2021, p. 4)

    “The PANELFIT Guidelines (Guidelines on Data Protection ELI in ICT Research and Innovation by the PANELFIT Project) have been conceived as a complex tool aimed at serving as a handbook of information about the regulatory framework on ICT data protection Ethical and Legal issues.
    Therefore, The Guidelines are mainly focused on the research and innovation community working on the ICT field. They have been conceived to make it easier for researchers to fulfill their legal and ethical obligations in this regard.
    These materials, which have been selected based on internal consensus, have been produced through a long and complex co-creation process. The first drafts were produced by the PanelfitConsortium members and then sent to more than 25 reviewers. Their comments were integrated in the materials and a second version created. On this basis, a second review was performed. Finally, the updated versions were validated by an additional external expert with expertise on data protection issues at the DPA level.  Concrete information about the names of the authors and the concrete reviewers who helped as to create these materials has been included in each section.
    The Guidelines produced by PANELFIT are mainly aimed at showing the legal issues regarding data processing. An impressive amount of information about ethical issues can be found in the SHERPA project website (https://www.project-sherpa.eu/)” from main site https://guidelines.panelfit.eu/

    “The CCDP aims to provide an easy-to-understand set of conduct rules that cover the main principles provided in the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), as well as a set of desirable practices, specifically tailored to the research community.2 There are multiple codes of conduct relating to responsible research and innovation. However, these existing codes of conduct do not seek to provide guidance on data protection principles, which is a gap this CCDP seeks to fill.” (Prakash, 2021, p. 3)

    “The CCDP seeks to be an introductory text to data protection principles, and does not seek to cover all aspects of the GDPR that may be of concern to researchers. Thus, for instance, the CCDP does not seek to cover all of the obligations that a researcher may have under data protection laws, nor all the rights of individuals whose personal data are used by researchers, or the legal requirements around sharing of personal data with research colleagues outside the EU, national-level laws on data protection, and so on. The PANELFIT project has also created ‘Guidelines on Data Protection Ethical and Legal Issues in ICT Research and Innovation’, which aims to be much more comprehensive in this regard.” (Prakash, 2021, p. 3)
    “Annexure 3: Process for Creating the Code of Conduct on Data Protection for Responsible Research and Innovation We sought to involve multiple stakeholders in the review of the CCDP and obtain as much feedback as possible. The consultation process is described below. The first draft of the CCDP was circulated in October 2020 and the final version was consolidated in August 2021. Five versions were generated at different stages of the process, incorporating feedback at each step. The following sections summarize the CCDP feedback process, capture the most significant comments received, and the steps taken to respond in each case. The scope of each of the feedback stages is described below:” (Prakash, 2021, p. 15)
    “• Consultation of internal experts (PANELFIT): the first version of the CCDP generated in October 2020 was reviewed by the PANELFIT Project consortium that includes experts in cybersecurity, governance, privacy, data protection, among others. • Consultation of external experts (stakeholders): this consultation was carried out through the Mutual Learning Encounter for stakeholders organized by the project. In this online event held on April 20 2021, 13 people from the following organizations met: ALLEA, European Group on Ethics (EGE) to the European Commission, University of Vilnius, NEC Laboratories Europe, Tech Uni Cluj-Napoca, Museum for Naturkunde, COCIR, Babes-Bolyai University, Research Centre for Data Science and Senior Lecturer, School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics at Coventry University, Uni Babes Bolyai, European Commission, Open Science (DG RTD), Tilburg University, School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics at Coventry University, University of Copenhagen. • Consultation of external researchers: researchers from various disciplines participated in the Mutual Learning Encounter for researchers organized by the project. The online event was held on June 24 2021. • Public consultation: the CCDP was published on the PANELFIT website with a form available to receive feedback from any interested person. Participation in feedback was promoted through social networks and mailing lists. The document was available from March to August 2021 at the following link: https://www.panelfit.eu/a-code-of-conduct-on-data-protection-for-responsible-researchand-innovation-ccdp/ • Survey of researchers: the survey was part of the CCDP feedback closing process. It was circulated before, during and after MLE for researchers. The feedback contributed to the improvement of the good practices section.” (Prakash, 2021, p. 16)

  note: "Structure:\n\nSets out brief background to document \n\n\nProvides a list
    of questions to which answers are provided\n\nUnder what conditions would collection
    of data for AI or AI validation activities meet the Common Rule definition of
    research that is “designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge”?\n\n\nWhen
    AI involves research involving private identifiable information (PII), when are
    those persons human subjects? Does the research capture the “about whom” part
    of the HS definition? Are there other ethical considerations for these persons?\n\n\nWhen
    would collection of data for AI or AI validation activities typically be exempt
    under the Common Rule?\n\n\nFor studies requiring review under the Common Rule,
    what human subject protections considerations are most prominent for the humans
    whose information is included in datasets used and shared for AI development?
    Do those considerations differ where the research is focused on the testing or
    validating of AI? Are other ethical considerations relevant for those who are
    not human subjects?\n\n\nAre there existing frameworks or tools that funding agencies,
    investigators, HRPP staff, and IRBs can use to illuminate and mitigate ethical
    concerns with human-focused AI research and development?\n\n\nAre there considerations
    specific to AI that impact the adequacy of disclosure of research activities in
    the research informed consent form?\n\n\nWhat is “unique” about research that
    includes AI that would require the IRB to think about and determine the applicability
    of the Common Rule that isn’t already considered for all human subject’s research?\n\n\nWhat
    specific sections of 45 CFR 46.111 would need special attention in research with
    AI; i.e., privacy and confidentiality; informed consent; risks?\n\n\nWhat are
    the specific considerations regarding AI that are pertinent to institutional /HRPP
    responsibilities, versus responsibilities for other studies under the purview
    of the IRB?\n\n\nIs there a larger potential for bias and/or flaws in the use
    of AI in research and how should IRB’s think about this potential in their review?
    (i.e. facial recognition algorithms could be heavily based on white males, but
    the researchers “using the algorithm” might not be aware of this.)\n\n\n\nSets

    “In order to gain a better understanding of the social, ethical, and legal issues of Presence technologies, the Peach team conducted a number of empirical analyses. In view of the still limited experience with Presence technologies in everyday life, we pursued two approaches. First, we conducted in-depth case studies of the four Integrated Projects (IPs) PRESENCCIA, IPCity, PASION, and IMMERSENCE (section 2.1). Second, we systematically gathered input from the Peach community on the occasion of several events (see section 2.2).These events included brainstorming and feedback sessions explicitly focused on social, ethical, and legal issues, but also open debates and discussions at other events, where the Peach team observed, solicited, and discussed the experiences and ideas of researchers and industry representatives involved with Presence technologies on a daily basis.” (Schroeder et al., 2009, p. 9)

    “This deliverable describes the review of AI impact assessments (AI-IAs) undertaken as part of the SHERPA project impact acceleration activities. The identification of AI-IAs was undertaken by following several established methods. This started with a search of four relevant databases (Scopus, ACM, ISI, IEEE) to identify documents that had undergone academic peer review. In addition, web searches were undertaken using three search engines (Google, Duckduck Go, Bing). Finally, the consortium undertook snowball and peer searches, which included a mailout to experts and relevant email lists to identify documents. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria a population of 37 AI-IAs remained which was fully analysed. The analysis covered the following topics in each of the documents: - Purpose - Scope - Organisational context - Issues (to be identified in the AI-IAs) - Timeframe - Process and methods - Transparency - Challenges The analysis shows that there is a certain level of coherence between the AI-IAs, but there are also significant differences. Numerous challenges remain, e.g. conceptual consistency, status of the AI-IA, the possibility of misuse and ethics washing and their role in the broader societal discussion of AI and ethics. We therefore develop a baseline for AI-IAs that can help decisionmakers decide which AI-IA they wish to use or to develop bespoke ones where needed. The conclusion, in line with the other work of the SHERPA project is that AI-IAs have a potentially important role to play. They need to be understood, however, in the context of rapidly evolving AI innovation ecosystems. In order to be useful in this context, they need to be continually reviewed and revised and integrated with other ways of addressing the ethics of AI, such as standardisation, education, regulation and they need to be embedded in social and organisational processes.” (Stahl, Bernd et al., 2021, p. 5)

    “BERA Council decided to commission a small-scale research project to illuminate dimensions of quality in CtP research (Wyse et al 2018). This statement draws upon that research, and is intended to guide the work of BERA members and the educational research community more widely in conducting, commissioning and advising on CtP research.” (Wyse et al., 2018, p. 2)
    “This BERA Close-to-Practice research project addressed the overarching research question, ‘How can high quality close-to-practice research be characterised and enhanced for education in the UK?’ The project had two phases. 1. A rapid evidence assessment of published research papers that focussed on close-to-practice (CtP) research. These papers were of two main types: a. those that focussed on the methodology of CtP research b. those that present findings from research that was close to practice. 2. Interviews with people who had relevant knowledge and experience in relation to CtP research and its qualities. The interviewees included both people who held very senior leadership roles in education and education research, and those whose work meant that they were close to practice on a day-to-day basis – those involved in teacher education, for example. The rapid evidence assessment looked at traditions of CtP research in order to arrive at a working definition, and also examined research quality in a selection of CtP research papers. This phase of work resulted in the following new definition of CtP research. Close-to-practice research is research that focusses on aspects defined by practitioners as relevant to their practice, and often involves collaborative work between practitioners and researchers.1 One of the striking findings of the rapid evidence assessment was the wide range of methodological traditions of CtP research – among them action research, participatory research, practitioner research/enquiry, design-based research, lesson study, knowledge exchange/transfer/ mobilisation/K*, and research learning communities. Furthermore, there were broader trends such as evidence-informed policy and evidenceinformed practice. Some of these traditions, such as action research, were more well established than others, such as research learning communities. However, irrespective of their histories, there was scope for research conducted in any of the traditions to be either higher or” (Wyse et al., 2018, p. 1)
    “lower quality, depending on the rigour of the research conducted within each particular methodology. Our review of 1,343 potentially relevant titles and abstracts found that the most frequent traditions were practitioner research (252 titles/abstracts) and action research (204). Findings that emerged from the interviewing process revealed that the action research subset typified how CtP research is generally perceived in the UK; time constraints also militated in favour of focussing specifically on the subset of research papers in the action research tradition (as opposed to the other 16 traditions we identified) for our analysis of education studies. Of 47 potentially relevant titles/abstracts in the action research tradition we found that 19, upon examining the full texts, were not CtP research. The remaining 28 were judged in terms of their originality, significance and rigour. We judged six studies (only one of which was UK-based) to be high in quality, 11 to be medium in quality and 11 low in quality. Only 17 of the 47 potentially relevant papers presented UK-based CtP research. They addressed teaching in maths (5 studies), science (6), English (5) and maths and science (1). In the second phase of the research, the interview phase, some of our interviewees noted the potential of CtP research to connect and contextualise theory and policy as a result of mutual recognition – by practitioners, researchers and policymakers – of problems in education that could be seen as problems of mutual interest to all three groups. The research team concluded that the best CtP research gave a full and rigorous account of whichever methodology had been selected. Fundamental aspects of chosen research designs were in place – for example, a minimum of two cycles of action and research in action research designs. In weaker CtP research, methodology was not explained in sufficient depth. The lack of a sufficiently rigorous account of data analysis was the methodological aspect that was frequently neglected, particularly in qualitative research. As a result of the analysis of quality in the selection of CtP studies, the definition of CtP research given above was augmented by the following supplementary definition of high quality in CtP research. High quality in close-to-practice research requires the robust use of research design, theory and methods to address clearly defined research questions, through an iterative process of research and application that includes reflections on practice, research, and context.2” (Wyse et al., 2018, p. 2)
    “This research report also includes some recommendations for BERA: for example, the need to provide guidance to the field on quality in CtP research; the need to engage with the field, including some of the newer sites for CtP research, in order to support the application of a wider range of methods to CtP problems; and engagement with universities to raise awareness and promote the career development of those who carry out CtP research, in recognition of their importance to education as a discipline.” (Wyse et al., 2018, p. 3)
