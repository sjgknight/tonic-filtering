Justice involves concern that the benefits and burdens of research must be fairly distributed; those who bear the greatest burden should benefit from the outcomes of research, and established inequities should be considered in making judgements regarding research foci and participation.


"
1. 4 In research that is just:
1. (a) taking into account the scope and objectives of the proposed research, the selection, exclusion and inclusion of categories of research participants is fair, and is accurately described in the results of the research
1. (b) the process of recruiting participants is fair
1. (c) there is no unfair burden of participation in research on particular groups
1. (d) there is fair distribution of the benefits of participation in research
1. (e) there is no exploitation of participants in the conduct of research
1. (f) there is fair access to the benefits of research.
1. 5 Research outcomes should be made accessible to research participants in a way that is timely and clear." (NS
1. 4-
1. 5)

“   Treat all individuals equally and protect social equity
    Use digital technologies as an essential support for the protection of fair and equal treatment under the law
    Prioritise social welfare, public interest, and the consideration of the social and ethical impacts of innovation in determining the legitimacy and desirability of AI technologies
    Use AI to empower and to advance the interests and well-being of as many individuals as possible
    Think big-picture about the wider impacts of the AI technologies you are conceiving and developing. Think about the ramifications of their effects and externalities for others around the globe, for future generations, and for the biosphere as a whole” (Leslie, 2019, p. 11)

> “The development, deployment and use of AI systems must be fair. While we acknowledge that there are many different interpretations of fairness, we believe that fairness has both a substantive and a procedural dimension. The substantive dimension implies a commitment to: ensuring equal and just distribution of both benefits and costs, and ensuring that individuals and groups are free from unfair bias, discrimination and stigmatisation. If unfair biases can be avoided, AI systems could even increase societal fairness. Equal opportunity in terms of access to education, goods, services and technology should also be fostered. Moreover, the use of AI systems should never lead to people being deceived or unjustifiably impaired in their freedom of choice. Additionally, fairness implies that AI practitioners should respect the principle of proportionality between means and ends, and consider carefully how to “balance competing interests and objectives.31 The procedural dimension of fairness entails the ability to contest and seek effective redress against decisions made by AI systems and by the humans operating them.32 In order to do so, the entity accountable for the decision must be identifiable, and the decision-making processes should be explicable.” (High-Level Expert Group on AI, 2019, p. 13-14)
