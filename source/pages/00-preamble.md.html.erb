Simon Knight, authors, (2023). Ethical Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Research.

The materials are intended to support disaggregation and remixing in the following ways:

-	The components of the guideline are presented both compiled in a single document, and separately so that each element may be used separately
-	The material may be added to, or adjusted e.g. to reflect different disciplinary foci or ethical concepts of relevance to a particular context. For example, a subset of the material focuses directly on applications of AI in learning, but we anticipate this may be added to.


## Audience

This matters to you if

Research permeats society.

Non-university based research institutes
Companies that conduct research

While private organisations may have different needs with respect to intellectual property and commercial sensitivity,


This guide is also intended to be written in a way that is broadly accessible. If, as researchers, we want people to engage with and understand the value of research, we must be able to publicly account for that value, through the impact of the work in society, grounded in rigorous, responsible, research.


Researchers, particularly in context of AI and learning.
Lines are fluid between users, participants, researchers, and providers of various kinds (from policy makers to technology companies),.
This guideline is targeted at research contexts, recognising that research occurs in many settings, and may be led by or involve many different stakeholders.
By research we meanâ€¦
We have tried to indicate considerations that are specific to education and AI, and those that are more general in nature.
