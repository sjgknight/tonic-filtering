<p> The idea of this collection was to collate a set of ethics guidelines particularly focused on education and AI (separately and together). The focal guidelines are under various open licenses, that should permit their reuse in this way; each element from the items should be cited. </p>

<p> This setup allows us to disaggregate the various elements, and to map connections: </p>

<ul>
<li> Inter-guideline, i.e., between them. So we can see which elements are similar/different, and draw on the resources of one guideline in addressing challenges or principles from another </li>
<li> Intra-guideline, i.e., within them. So we can see really clearly how, e.g., particular challenges relate to the principles within the document itself. Some guidelines do this explicitly but through a flat document, while often it is implicit. </li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an example of pulling the filtered data in, in a pre-defined way. </p>

</div>

<h3> Examples of 'SoTL' in Title, and category is 'Strategies' </h3>

<%
  # Filter the tonic_collection based on specific conditions
  # match looks for the text, category is obvious, etc.
  display_items = tonic_collection.select do |item|
    item[:title]&.match(/SoTL/i) && item[:category] == "Strategies"
  end
%>

<div id="collection-container" class="mt-4 grid sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6">
  <% display_items.each do |item| %>
    <%= partial 'templates/collection/item_card', locals: { item: item } %>
