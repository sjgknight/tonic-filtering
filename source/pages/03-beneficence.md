Minimise the risks of harms (non-maleficence)

Conduct work that benefits people (beneficence)


1. 6 The likely benefit of the research must justify any risks of harm or discomfort to participants. The likely benefit may be to the participants, to the wider community, or to both.
1. 7 Researchers are responsible for:
1. (a) designing the research to minimise the risks of harm or discomfort to participants
1. (b) clarifying for participants the potential benefits and risks of the research
1. (c) the welfare of the participants in the research context.
1. 8 Where there are no likely benefits to participants, the risk to participants should be lower than would be ethically acceptable where there are such likely benefits.
1. 9 Where the risks to participants are no longer justified by the potential benefits of the research, the research must be suspended to allow time to consider whether it should be discontinued or at least modified. This decision may require consultation between researchers, participants, the relevant ethical review body, and the institution. The review body must be notified promptly of such suspension, and of any decisions following it (see paragraphs
1.
1. 7 to

#### Practically

Risk evaluation and mitigation (jobin)
Monitoring/precaution (Jobin)
Safety and reliability (Fjeld, Schiff, Khan)
Fairness and non-discrimination (Fjeld, Khan, Schiff,)

This goes beyond just checking for bias

#### Particular types of harm to be aware of:

- H-H interactions
- H-R relaionships
- psychological impacts

- AGI and existential threats
- deception and manipulation
- misuse and dual use
- surveillance
- arms race

Data security, and the issues under respect for persons central here too

Awareness of misuse:
> "New technologies give rise to greater risk of deliberate or accidental misuse, and this is especially true for A/IS. A/IS increases the impact of risks such as hacking, misuse of personal data, system manipulation, or exploitation of vulnerable users by unscrupulous parties. Cases of A/IS hacking have already been widely reported, with driverless cars, for example. The Microsoft Tay AI chatbot was famously manipulated when it mimicked deliberately offensive users. In an age where these powerful tools are easily available, there is a need for a new kind of education for citizens to be sensitized to risks associated with the misuse of A/IS. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides measures to remedy the misuse of personal data.Responsible innovation requires A/IS creators to anticipate, reflect, and engage with users of A/IS. Thus, citizens, lawyers, governments, etc., all have a role to play through education and awareness in developing accountability structures (see Principle 6), in addition to guiding new technology proactively toward beneficial ends." [(IEEE, 2019, p.32-33)](/reccfsnzpjvw0pcue)

>“AI systems should neither cause nor exacerbate harm29 or otherwise adversely affect human beings.30 This entails the protection of human dignity as well as mental and physical integrity. AI systems and the environments in which they operate must be safe and secure. They must be technically robust and it should be ensured that they are not open to malicious use. Vulnerable persons should receive greater attention and be included in the development, deployment and use of AI systems. Particular attention must also be paid to situations where AI systems can cause or exacerbate adverse impacts due to asymmetries of power or information, such as between employers and employees, businesses and consumers or governments and citizens. Preventing harm also entails consideration of the natural environment and all living beings.” (High-Level Expert Group on AI, 2019, p. 12)
