The designers of A/IS need to be mindful of cross-cultural ethical variations while also respecting widely held international legal norms.## RecommendationEstablish a leading role for [intercultural information ethics ](http://www.capurro.de/iie.html)(IIE) practitioners in ethics committees informing technologists, policy makers, and engineers. Clearly demonstrate through examples how cultural variation informs not only information flows and information systems, but also algorithmic decision-making and value by design.## Further Resources•D.

A necessary step in enabling machines to do so is to identify these norms. But which norms should be identified? Laws are publicly documented and therefore easy to identify, so they can be incorporated into A/IS as long as they do not violate humanitarian or community moral principles. Social and moral norms are more difficult to ascertain, as they are expressed through behavior, language, customs, cultural symbols, and artifacts. Most important, communities ranging from families to whole nations differ to various degrees in the norms they follow. Therefore, generating a universal set of norms that applies to all A/IS in all contexts is not realistic, but neither is it advisable to completely tailor the A/IS to individual preferences. We suggest that it is feasible to identify broadly observed norms of communities in which a technology is deployed.Furthermore, the difficulty of generating a universal set of norms is not inconsistent with the goal of seeking agreement over Universal Human Rights (see the “General Principles” chapter of _Ethically Aligned Design_). However, these universal rights are not sufficient for devising A/IS that conform to the specific norms of its community. Universal Human Rights must, however, constrain the kinds of norms that are implemented in the A/IS (cf. van de Poel 20168).Embedding norms in A/IS requires a careful understanding of the communities in which the A/IS are to be deployed. Further, even within a particular community, different types of A/IS will demand different sets of norms. The relevant norms for self-driving vehicles, for example,may differ greatly from those for robots usedin healthcare. Thus, we recommend that to develop A/IS capable of following legal, social, and moral norms, the first step is to identify the norms of the specific community in which theA/IS are to be deployed and, in particular, norms relevant to the kinds of tasks and roles for which the A/IS are designed. Even when designating a narrowly defined community, e.g., a nursing home, an apartment complex, or a company, there will be variations in the norms that apply, or in their relative weighting. The norm identification process must heed such variation and ensure that the identified norms are representative, not only of the dominant subgroup in the community but also of vulnerable and underrepresented groups.The most narrowly defined “community” is a single person, and A/IS may well have to adapt to the unique expectations and needs of a given individual, such as the arrangement of a disabled person’s living accommodations. However, unique individual expectations must not violate norms in the larger community. Whereas the arrangement of someone’s kitchen or the frequency with which a care robot checks in with a patient can be personalized without violating any community norms, encouraging the robot to use derogatory language to talk about certain social groups does violate such norms. In the next section, we discuss how A/IS might handle such norm conflicts.Innovation projects and development efforts for A/IS should always rely on empirical research, involving multiple disciplines and multiple methods; to investigate and document both context- and task-specific norms, spoken and unspoken, that typically apply in a particular community. Such a set of empirically identified norms should then guide system design. This process of norm identification and implementation must be iterative and revisable. A/IS with an initial set of implemented norms may betray biases of original assessments (Misra, Zitnick, Mitchell, and Girshick 20169) that can be revealed by interactions with, and feedback from, the relevant community. This leads to a process of norm updating, which is described next in Issue 2.## RecommendationTo develop A/IS capable of following social and moral norms, the first step is to identify the norms of the specific community in which theA/IS are to be deployed and, in particular, norms relevant to the kinds of tasks and roles that the A/IS are designed for. This norm identification process must use appropriate scientific methods and continue through the system's life cycle.## Further Resources•Mack, Ed., “Changing social norms.” _Social Research: An International Quarterly,_ 85, no.1, 1–271, 2018.•I.

They change over time, in response to social progress, political change, new legal measures, or novel opportunities (Mack 201810). Norms can fade away when, for whatever reasons, fewer and fewer people adhere to them. And new norms emerge when technological innovation invites novel behaviors and novel standards, e.g., cell phone use in public.A/IS should be equipped with a starting set of social and legal norms before they are deployed in their intended community (see Issue 1), but this will not suffice for A/IS to behave appropriately over time. A/IS or the designers of A/IS, must be adept at identifying and adding new norms to its starting set, because the initial norm identification process in the community will undoubtedly have missed some norms and because the community’s norms change.Humans rely on numerous capacities to update their knowledge of norms and learn new ones. They observe other community members’ behavior and are sensitive to collective norm change; they explicitly ask about new norms when joining new communities, e.g., entering college or a job in a new town; and they respond to feedback from others when they exhibit uncertainty about norms or have violated a norm.Likewise, A/IS need multiple capacities to improve their own norm knowledge and to adapt to a community’s dynamically changing norms. These capacities include:•Processing behavioral trends by members of the target community and comparing them to trends predicted by the baseline norm system,•Asking for guidance from the community when uncertainty about applicable norms exceeds a critical threshold,•Responding to instruction from the community members who introduce a robot to a previously unknown context or who notice the A/IS’ uncertainty in a familiar context, and•Responding to formal or informal feedback from the community when the A/IS violatea norm.The modification of a normative system can occur at any level of the system: it could involve altering the priority weightings between individual norms, changing the qualitative expression of a norm, or altering the quantitative parameters that enable the norm.We recommend that the system’s norm changes be transparent. That is, the system or its designer should consult with users, designers, and community representatives when adding new norms to its norm system or adjusting the priority or content of existing norms. Allowing a system to learn new norms without public or expert review has detrimental consequences (Green and Hu 201811). The form of consultation and the specific review process will vary by machine sophistication-e.g., linguistic capacity and function/role, or a flexible social companion versus a task-defined medical robot-and best practices will have to be established. In some cases, the system may document its dynamic change, and the user can consult this documentation as desired. In other cases, explicit announcements and requests for discussion with the designer may be appropriate. In yet other cases, the A/IS may propose changes, and the relevant human community, e.g., drawn from a representative crowdsourced panel, will decide whether such changes should be implementedin the system.## RecommendationTo respond to the dynamic change of norms in society A/IS or their designers must be able to amend their norms or add new ones, while being transparent about these changes to users,designers, broader community representatives, and other stakeholders.## Further Resources•B.

Such situations—often described as moral dilemmas or moral overload (Van den Hoven 201212)—must be computationally tractable by A/IS; they cannot simply stop in their tracks and end on a logical contradiction. Humans resolve such situations by accepting trade-offs between conflicting norms, which constitute priorities of one norm or value over another in a given context. Such priorities may be represented in the norm system as hierarchical relations.Along with identifying the norms within a specific community and task domain, empirical research must identify the ways in which people prioritize competing norms and resolve norm conflicts, and the ways in which people expect A/IS to resolve similar norm conflicts. These more local conflict resolutions will be further constrained by some general principles, such as the “Common Good Principle” (Andre and Velasquez 199213) or local and national laws. For example, a self-driving vehicle’s prioritization of one factor over another in its decision-making will need to reflect the laws and norms of the population in which the A/IS are deployed, e.g., the traffic laws of a U.S. state and the United States as a whole.Some priority orders can be built into a given norm network as hierarchical relations, e.g.,more general prohibitions against harm to humans typically override more specific norms against lying. Other priority orders can stem from the override that norms in the larger communityexert on norms and preferences of an individual user. In the earlier example discussing personalization (see Issue 1), the A/IS of a racist user who demands the A/IS use derogatory language for certain social groups will have to resist such demands because community norms hierarchically override an individual user’s preferences. In many cases, priority orders are not built in as fixed hierarchies because the priorities are themselves context-specific or may arise from net moral costs and benefits of the particular case at hand. A/IS must have learning capacities to track such variations and incorporate user and community input, e.g., about the subtle differences between contexts, so as to refine the system’s norm network (see Issue 2).Tension may sometimes arise between a community’s social and legal norms and the normative considerations of designers or manufacturers. Democratic processes may need to be developed that resolve this tension— processes that cannot be presented in detail in this chapter. Often such resolution will favor the local laws and norms, but in some cases the community may have to be persuaded to accept A/IS favoring international law or broader humanitarian principles over, say, racist or sexist local practices. In general, we recommend that the system’s resolution of norm conflicts be transparent—that is, documented by the system and ready to be made available to users, the relevant community of deployment, and third-party evaluators. Just like people explain to each other why they made decisions, they will expect any A/IS to be able to explain their decisions and be sensitive to user feedback about the appropriateness of the decisions. To do so, design and development of A/IS should specifically identify the relevant groups of humans who may request explanations and evaluate the systems’ behaviors. In the case of a system detecting a norm conflict, the system should consult and offer explanations to representatives from the community, e.g., randomly sampled crowdsourced members or elected officials, as well as to third-party evaluators, with the goal of discussing and resolving the norm conflict.## RecommendationA/IS developers should identify the ways in which people resolve norm conflicts and the ways in which they expect A/IS to resolve similar norm conflicts. A system’s resolution of norm conflicts must be transparent—that is, documented by the system and ready to be made available to users, the relevant community of deployment, and third-party evaluators.## Further resources•M.

"p.172-174"**Issue 1:** Not all norms of a target community apply equally to human and artificial agents## BackgroundAn intuitive criterion for evaluations of norms embedded in A/IS would be that the A/IS norms should mirror the community’s norms—that is, the A/IS should be disposed to behave the same way that people expect each other to behave. However, for a given community and a givenA/IS use context, A/IS and humans are unlikely to have identical sets of norms. People will have some unique expectations for humans than they do not for machines, e.g., norms governing the regulation of negative emotions, assuming that machines do not have such emotions. People may in some cases have unique expectations of A/IS that they do not have for humans, e.g., a robot worker, but not a human worker, is expected to work without regular breaks.## RecommendationThe norm identification process must document the similarities and differences between the norms that humans apply to other humans and the norms they apply to A/IS. Norm implementations should be evaluatedspecifically against the norms that thecommunity expects the A/IS to follow."p.183</div>
