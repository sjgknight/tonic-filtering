  <div class="text-gray-500">"**Issue:** Education to prepare the future workforce, in both HIC and LMIC, to design ethical A/IS applications or to have a comparative advantage in working alongside A/IS, is either lacking or unevenly available, risking inequality perpetuated across generations, within and between countries, constraining equitable growth, supporting a sustainable future, and achievement of the SDGs.## BackgroundMultiple international institutions, in particular educational engineering organizations,27 have called on universities to play an active role, both locally and globally, in the resolution of the enormous problems that the world faces in securing peace, prosperity, planet protection, and universal human dignity: armed conflict, social injustice, rapid climate change, abuse of human rights, etc. Addressing global social problems is one of the central objectives of many universities, transversal to their other functions, including research in A/IS. UNESCO points out that universities’ preparation of future scientists and engineers for social responsibility is presently very limited, in view of the enormous ethical and social problems associated with technology.28 Enhancing the global dimension of engineeringin undergraduate and postgraduate A/IS education is necessary, so that students canbe prepared as technical professionals, awareof the opportunities and risks that A/IS present, and ready for work anywhere in the world inany sector.Engineering studies at the university and postgraduate levels is just one dimension of the A/IS education challenge. For instance, business, law, public policy, and medical students will also need to be prepared for professions where A/IS are a partner, and to have internalized ethical principles to guide the deployment of such technologies. LMIC need financial and academic support to incorporate global A/IS professional curricula in their own universities, and all countries need to develop the pipeline by preparing elementary and secondary school students to access such professional programs. While the need for curriculum reform is recognized, the impact of A/IS on various professions and socioeconomic contexts is, at this time, both evolving and largely undocumented. Thus, the overhaul of education systems at all levels should be preceded by A/IS research.Much of LMIC education is not globally competitive today, so there is a risk that the global advent of A/IS could negatively affect the chances of young people in LMIC finding productive employment, further fueling global inequality. Education systems worldwide have to be reformed and transformed to fit the new demands of the information age, in view of the changing mix of skills demanded from the workforce.29 In 21st century education, it has been observed that children need less rote knowledge, given so much is instantly accessible on the web and more tools to network and innovate are available; less memory and more imagination should be developed; and fewer physical books and more internet access is required. Young people everywhere need to develop their capacities for creativity, human empathy, ethics, and systems thinking in order to work productively alongside robots and A/IS technologies. Science, Technology, Engineering, Art/design, and Math (STEAM) subjects need to be more extensive and more creatively taught.30 In addition, research is needed to establish ways that a new subject, empathy, can be added to these crucial 21st century subjects in order to educate the future A/IS workforce in social skills. Instead, in rich and poor countries alike, children are continuing to be educated for an industrial age which has disappeared or never even arrived. LMIC education systems, being less entrenched in many countries, may have the potential to be more flexible than those in HIC. Perhaps A/IS can be harnessed to help educational systems to leapfrog into the 21st century, just as mobile phone technology enabled LMIC leapfrog over the phase of wired communication infrastructure.## RecommendationsEducation with respect to A/IS must be targeted to three sets of students: the general public, present and future professionals in A/IS, and present and future policy makers. To prepare the future workforce to develop culturally appropriate A/IS, to work productively and ethically alongside such technologies, and to advance the UN SDGs, the curricula in HIC and LMIC universities and professional schools require innovation. Equally importantly, preuniversity education systems, starting with early childhood education, need to be reformed to prepare society for the risks and opportunities of the A/IS age, rather than the current system which prepares society for work in an industrial age that ended with the 20th century. Specific recommendations include:•Preparing future managers, lawyers, engineers, civil servants, and entrepreneurs to work productively and ethically as global citizens alongside A/IS, through reform of undergraduate and graduate curricula as well as of preschool, primary, and secondary school curricula. This will require:•Fomenting interaction between universities and other actors such as companies, governments, NGOs, etc., with respect to A/IS research through definition of research priorities and joint projects, subcontracts to universities, participation in observatories, and co-creation of curricula, cooperative teaching, internships/service learning, and conferences/seminars/courses.•Establishing and supporting more multidisciplinary degrees that includeA/IS, and adapting university curricula to provide a broad, integrated perspective which allows students to understand the impact of A/IS in the global, economic, environmental, and sociocultural domains and trains them as future policy makers in A/IS fields.•Integrating the teaching of ethics andA/IS across the education spectrum, from preschool to postgraduate curricula, instead of relegating ethics to a standalone module with little direct practical application.•Promoting service learning opportunities that allow A/IS undergraduate and graduate students to apply their knowledge to meet the needs of a community.•Creating international exchange programs, through both private and public institutions, which expose students to different cultural contexts for A/IS applications in both HIC and LMIC.•Creating experimental curricula to prepare people for information-based work in the 21st century, from preschool through postgraduate education.•Taking into account transversal competencies students need to acquire to become ethical global citizens, i.e., critical thinking, empathy, sociocultural awareness, flexibility, and deontological reasoningin the planning and assessment ofA/IS curricula.• Training teachers in teaching methodologies suited to addressing challenges imposed in the age of A/IS. •Stimulating STEAM courses in preuniversity education.•Encouraging high-quality HIC-LMIC collaborative A/IS research in both private and public universities.•Conducting research to support innovation in education and business for the A/IS world, which could include:•Researching the impact of A/IS on the governance and macro/micro strategies of companies and organizations, together with those companies, in an interdisciplinary manner which harnesses expertise of both social scientists and technology experts.•Researching the impact of A/IS on the business model for the development of new products and services through the collaborative efforts of management, operations, and the technical research and development function.•Researching how empathy can be taught and integrated into curricula, starting at the preschool level.•Researching how schools and education systems in low-income settings of both HIC and LMIC can leverage their lessentrenched interests to leapfrog into a 21st century-ready education system.•Establishing ethics observatories in universities with the purpose of fostering an informed public opinion capableof participating in policy decisionsregarding the ethics and social impactof A/IS applications.•Creating professional continuing education and employment opportunities in A/IS for current professionals, including through online and executive education courses.•Creating educative mass media campaigns to elevate society’s ongoing baseline level of understanding of A/IS systems, including what it is, if and how it can be trusted in various contexts, and what are its limitations.## Further resources•ABET Computing and Engineering Accreditation Criteria 2018.
